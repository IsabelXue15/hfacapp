Pitch,Summary
Daniel__FirstSolar__SIR.pdf,"Summary:
First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR) is a global provider of photovoltaic solar energy solutions, specializing in utility-scale PV modules and solar projects. The company has a strong balance sheet, scalability in production, and a high operating leverage. With a focus on CdTe thin-film technology, First Solar has a competitive advantage in the industry. The company has been expanding into untapped markets globally and has a diverse project pipeline.

Investment Rationale:
The recommendation for First Solar is LONG with a 30% upside potential. The company's continued leadership in the solar industry, future project opportunities, and cost advantages make it an attractive investment opportunity. First Solar is undervalued due to misconceptions about its competitive advantage and market potential. Key factors supporting the recommendation include unchallenged expansion into new markets, industry-leading cost advantages through CdTe technology, and a strategy to leverage regional variations in module prices.

Thesis:
The market uncertainty about the future of utility-scale solar in the U.S. and the underappreciation of First Solar's business model strengths and moat are key thesis points. The company's strategic geographic positioning, successful transition to Series 6 products, and industry consolidation are catalysts for growth. Risk factors include low global demand for solar solutions and potential removal of solar subsidies or tariffs.

Valuation:
First Solar's valuation range is estimated to be between $60.15 to $75.51 based on industry and comparables analysis. The earnings model suggests price targets ranging from $54.03 to $78.78 in bear, base, and bull scenarios.

Overall, the investment recommendation for First Solar is based on its strong market position, technological advantages, and growth potential in the solar industry."

Kiffen__RCM2__SIR.pdf,"FINANCIALS 3Q19 Quarterly Update

In the 3Q19 Quarterly Update, 2HFAC signed a new operating partner agreement with a large physician organization for a 7-year term. The annual customer NPR is approximately $700 million, and they expect a better steady financial contribution compared to the Operating Partner model. They are also adding opportunities to their pipeline. The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) broke out contribution to EBITDA and increased steady state expectations from 26% to 30%, with a projected $15-20 million contribution in 2020 and 20/30 automations in development. They have also made investments in a Patient Experience (PX) platform, resulting in a 58% decrease in patient wait time and an NPS score of around 75. Quorum update: they started transitioning work on October 1.

WHY WAS MARGIN EXPANSION NOT PRICED IN
The price change since earnings doesn't fully reflect the anticipated EBITDA margin improvement from a steady state of 26% to 30%. They believe that the margins will eventually manifest in the stock price as the DTO implementation is derisked over time. The initial steady state EBITDA margin before DTO margin improvement wasn't priced in either, likely due to uncertainty regarding the operating partner model, which is still relatively untested. They have not broken out specific numbers for Ascension Wave 1.

COMPANY PERFORMANCE
2HFAC reported $48.9 million in Adjusted EBITDA with a 16% EBITDA margin and $301.2 million in revenue. Their 2019 projections have been revised to a revenue range of $1,175-1,200 million, GAAP Income of $55-70 million, and Adj EBITDA of $165-170 million. For 2020, they project revenue between $1,250-1,400 million, GAAP Income of $140-170 million, and Adj EBITDA of $235-260 million. Despite these positive updates, the price change since earnings does not fully reflect the anticipated EBITDA margin improvement or the signing of a new partner. 2HFAC is confident about expanding into the Physician Org market.

COMPS
The U.S. medical billing outsourcing market is currently valued at around $4 billion and is projected to reach $7.8 billion by 2026, with a CAGR of 11% during the forecast period."
Mike__BKBR3__SIR.pdf,"Summary of 1BK Brasil Operação e Assessoria a Restaurantes S.A. (BOVESPA: BKBR3) Long Recommendation by Mike Johnson:

BK Brasil Operação e Assessoria a Restaurantes S.A. is a company listed on the BOVESPA stock exchange under the ticker symbol BKBR3. The company operates in the food and beverage industry, with two main brands - Burger King (800 restaurants) and Popeyes (17 restaurants). Burger King accounts for approximately 20% of its restaurants being franchised.

The company has shown rapid expansion, with 100 net openings in the last year, including 16 new restaurants opened in 2Q19 (10 Burger Kings and 6 Popeyes). BK Brasil is a blue-chip brand in a high-growth environment, with a presence in dessert centers, malls, and free-standing locations.

Key financials show a strong performance, with a gross margin of 60.4%, EBIT margin of 6.1%, and EBITDA margin of 12.0%. The company's enterprise value is $1,247.9 million with shares outstanding at 226.9 million.

The investment thesis for BK Brasil includes the belief that the recent overreaction to temporary increases in selling expenses has unduly deflated the share price, offering an entry point below intrinsic value. The company is seen as well-positioned in a booming, underpenetrated fast-food industry in Brazil, with strong brand recognition and a wide economic moat.

There are risks associated with the investment, such as price competition from competitors like Arcos Dorados and macroeconomic volatility. However, the company's strong brand value and positioning in a growing industry make it an attractive investment opportunity.

Valuation analysis suggests an upside potential of 45.7% based on conservative assumptions, with a best-case scenario showing a potential upside of 70.8%. The company's strong financial performance, brand value, and growth potential make it a compelling long recommendation for investors."
