Pitch,Summary
Collin__NYSMF__SIR.pdf,"Nautilus Minerals Inc. (NUSMF Pink, NUS TSX) is a company involved in seafloor resource exploration and development, specifically mining for copper, gold, silver, zinc, manganese, nickel, and cobalt. The company needs additional financing of $125-175 million to proceed with its current projects. They have halted new building contracts and reduced staff by 60% until financing is secured. Nautilus has secured bridge equity financing for one year and is in talks with potential investors, mainly from China.

The company's 2017 goals include securing additional funding and completing full exploration of Solwara. Nautilus aims to target hydrothermal vents down to 12,000 ft to extract valuable metals from massive sulfide deposits. Deep-sea mining offers benefits such as meeting rising demand for precious metals, reducing dependence on declining terrestrial mines, and having fewer damaging outputs with a smaller impact area. Nautilus has investors like Mawarid Offshore Mining Ltd. and Metalloinvest Holding Limited.

The company has developed technology from the offshore oil and gas industries, dredging, and onshore mining industries to create seafloor production tools, riser and lifting systems, and a production support vessel. The Solwara I project, located off Papua New Guinea in the Bismarck Sea, is the company's first target for mining operations. It holds high concentrations of valuable metals but has yet to undergo an economic study to confirm its viability.

Nautilus trades at a discount to book value and presents two potential paths for investors. The company's valuation and potential returns are outlined based on different financing scenarios. Overall, Nautilus Minerals Inc. offers an opportunity for investors to participate in deep-sea mining exploration with the potential for significant returns."

CURRENT PRICE: $26.53 (CAD)
RECOMMENDATION: LONG â€“ $32.38 PRICE TARGET

Investment Thesis:
There are misconceptions about Canada Goose's brand strength, doubts about its ability to maintain top-line growth, and concerns about the future state of luxury retail, which have led to the stock trading below its fair value. However, a fundamental analysis of Canada Goose reveals a different story, with a 60-year legacy, strong fiscal performance, and promising growth initiatives. The recommendation is to buy with a significant margin of safety due to continued expansion into new markets, introduction of new products, and a mature supply chain and distribution network. The team anticipates a successful Winter 2018 season, leading to a convergence on the true value of $29.19 (CAD) within 8-12 months.

Company Overview and Management:
Canada Goose is known for exceptional craftsmanship, authenticity, and quality. CEO Dani Reiss has grown the company into a $2B business over 16 years. The management team includes executives from leading global companies. The brand has potential beyond winter outerwear, with the possibility of expanding into new product lines and climates.

Product Mix and Revenue Streams:
Canada Goose offers best-in-class parkas and outerwear with a lifetime warranty, all made in Canada. The company targets the $800 to $1000 outerwear segment and does not intend to compete on price. Recent initiatives include launching a high-end knitwear line to drive sales.

Expansion into Untapped Geographies and Markets:
The company is focused on saturating existing markets and entering new regions through direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels. Key markets include the U.K., France, Russia, and China, where there is untapped luxury demand.

Consumer Demand and Satisfaction:
Recent consumer surveys show high satisfaction with Canada Goose products, with a high likelihood of repurchase. There is significant opportunity to accelerate sales in the United States and other regions.

Product Line Expansion Leveraging the Existing CG Brand:
Consumer interest in new product categories like knitwear, fleece, footwear, and bedding presents an opportunity to strengthen brand loyalty and expand into new markets. Parkas will remain a flagship product, but new lines will complement consumer spending.

Multichannel Distribution Network:
Canada Goose's multichannel distribution network includes e-commerce and brick-and-mortar stores, with plans to open more retail locations. Wholesale accounts for a majority of revenue and drives store traffic.

Selected Financial Observations:
Canada Goose has shown growth during peak seasons and is considered a successful ""three season retailer."" The company carries manageable debt and generates strong free cash flow. Returns to scale have improved cost margins, with future offerings expected to further reduce costs.

Industry and Comparables Analysis:
Canada Goose competes with Moncler, Burberry, and Arc'teryx in a fragmented industry. The stock is priced for high growth, with the potential for even higher growth.

End of Year Update:
Management plans to open new retail stores and expand globally. Recent store openings and future expansions indicate continued growth potential.

Bear Case - Price Target: $21.19 (CAD):
If growth initiatives fail, revenue may lag, cost margins may not improve, and operating expenses may remain high.

Bull Case - Price Target: $32.38:
If growth initiatives succeed, revenue growth will increase, cost margins will shrink, and operating expenses will decrease.

Overall, the recommendation is to buy Canada Goose stock with a long position and a target price of $32.38."
Jae__DeepDown__SIR.pdf,"Deep Down Inc (OTCMKTS: DPDW) is a company that provides support for subsea engineering, installation, and maintenance projects through specialized services and engineered solutions. The company has seen a downward trajectory in its stock price since 2013 due to losses and unfavorable macro conditions. However, the company has a strong balance sheet with a market cap of $12.1MM, working capital of $11.1MM, and cash on hand of $7.2MM.

Deep Down produces specialized products such as steel flying leads and carousels. The company's core products and services include the design, installation, and retrieval of subsea equipment, connection and termination operations, well-commissioning, and support services. The company's flying leads provide connections to structures on the sea floor, while carousels offer a spooling mechanism for subsea pipe and equipment storage.

The company's management is focused on improving business performance by shifting towards high-margin service work and expanding into non-oil and gas applications. Deep Down has also introduced a new patented technology, NHU umbilicals, which management believes could significantly increase the company's revenues.

The company has multiple catalysts for growth, including the sale or long-term lease of two carousels, a share buyback program, and the commercialization of the NHU technology. Deep Down is cash flow positive and has a strong balance sheet, with a margin of safety in its liquidation valuation. Despite risks such as fluctuating oil prices and lower margins, the company is undervalued and has the potential for significant upside.

In conclusion, Deep Down Inc is a cash-flow positive company with strong potential for growth and multiple catalysts for increasing shareholder value."

Kelvin__Chegg__SIR.pdf,"Summary: Chegg, Inc. is a student-first connected learning platform that initially focused on textbook rental/sale for college students but has since expanded into digital services such as online tutoring and test prep. The company IPO'd in 2013 and is currently trading at $8.04 with a market cap of $737M. Chegg has two main business segments: Required Materials (print and eTextbooks) and Chegg Services (online tutoring, study services, etc.). The thesis for shorting Chegg includes concerns about the barriers to entry in digital services, the overplayed growth story, and subscriber growth limitations. The target price for shorting the stock is $5.17, representing a 35.6% downside.

Industry Analysis: The education market is projected to grow at a 7% CAGR until 2017, with college student numbers expected to increase at a 1.5% CAGR until 2020. Chegg's market penetration and subscriber growth may be limited as the student market size is around 9 million enrolled students, with concerns about retention rates post-graduation.

Valuation: Assumptions for the short thesis include a 40% CAGR for subscriber growth eventually slowing to around 4.2 million, constant ARPU, gross margins reaching expectations, and a TAM of around 9 million with a 75% retention rate.

Catalysts: Potential catalysts for the short thesis include a realization of slowing subscriber growth post-transition to digital services and realistic earnings reports that reflect the already aggressive growth expectations.

Risks: Risks associated with shorting Chegg include a short squeeze due to high short interest, and potential further market penetration increasing TAM and subscriber numbers."
Michael__CTO__SIR.pdf,"Consolidated-Tomoka Land (NYSE: CTO) is a real estate operator that owns income-producing properties and land in Daytona Beach, Florida. They also hold mineral rights and operate a golf course. The original investment thesis was based on the undervaluation of the company's land holdings and potential for asset sales to unlock value. However, the company's management has not been shareholder-friendly, with slow progress on selling assets and issuing risky loans. The predicted catalysts did not significantly impact the stock price, leading to a recommendation to sell the position. The management's strategy has been questioned by shareholders, and the outlook for the company's performance is uncertain.

In summary, the recommendation is to sell the position in Consolidated-Tomoka Land due to concerns about management's actions, slow progress on asset sales, and the lack of positive impact from predicted catalysts on the stock price."
NewStar__SIR.pdf,"NewStar Financial, Inc. (NEWS), founded in 2004 and headquartered in Boston, MA, is a specialized, internally-managed commercial finance company. It operates in two main business lines: middle market direct lending and asset management, with more than $6 million in assets under management. The company is listed on NASDAQ with a market cap of $425.86M, a P/E ratio of 16.31, and an operating margin of 22.42%.

The company recently sold its equipment finance platform for $105 million cash, which was valued at 1.2x book value. This divestment allowed for the repurchase of 8.4% of outstanding shares, showing a shift towards core lending activities. Zacks Investment Research forecasts a 29.51% earnings growth for NEWS in 2017.

NewStar has a strong portfolio, with 97+% first lien exposure and minimal exposure to stressed sectors. The company has strategic partnerships with firms like Blackstone's GSO Capital and Franklin Square Funds, providing access to new channels of origination and larger capital commitments.

The company is currently undervalued, with its stock trading below book value. By using a Dividend Discount Model, it was calculated that the stock price should be $18.44, indicating a 74% upside potential from the current price. Comparables analysis also shows NEWS trading below book value with a higher ROE compared to peers.

In a worst-case scenario where the economy weakens, NewStar has additional liquidity to invest in other opportunities due to a strong portfolio and steady credit costs. The bear case price projection is $11.96, still indicating a 13% upside from the current price.

Overall, NewStar Financial, Inc. is recommended as a BUY, given the significant potential upside and strong fundamentals."
Retail__SIR.pdf,"Summary:

Retail Holdings N.V. (OTCPK: RHDGF) is a holding company with assets including a significant interest in Sewko Holdings, seller notes from the 2004 sale of Singer sewing business and trademark, and $0.7 million in cash. The company's CEO, Stephen Goodman, has a strong background in M&A and has taken actions to benefit shareholders in the past.

The investment thesis for Retail Holdings N.V. includes the company being traded at a 45% discount to NAV, with subsidiaries showing consistent growth and trading at reasonable P/E ratios. The catalyst for potential gain is the planned liquidation in 2-4 years, with management having experience in M&A and liquidation.

However, there are risks involved, such as the lack of due diligence in Seeking Alpha research, the uncertain method of liquidation, and potential political turmoil in the company's operating regions. Despite these risks, the company's strong financial metrics and market positioning provide a solid case for investment.

The revised valuation suggests a target price of $26.00, compared to the current price of $17.60. The company's past liquidations have shown promising results, with the preferred method being the sale of shares of subsidiaries. Overall, Retail Holdings N.V. presents an opportunity for investment with careful consideration of the risks involved.

Zahra__NTRP__SIR.pdf,"Neurotrope BioScience (NASDAQ: NTRP) is a three-year-old biotech company specializing in Alzheimer's drug treatment. They have 3 drugs under development, with Bryostatin-1 being the most advanced in Phase II trials. The company's stock price on April 4, 2017, was $18.61 with a market cap of $138.62M. They have a pending Phase IIb results in April 2017.

The company is undervalued due to the market overlooking small biotech companies focusing on AD drug development. The industry has a 99% failure rate associated with AD drugs. NTRP, previously trading OTC, has no analyst coverage until March 31, 2017.

NTRP's drug candidate, Bryostatin-1, has a unique mechanism of action targeting Protein Kinase C (PKC) and has shown promising results in Phase II trials. The management team, led by Dr. Daniel Alkon and Dr. Susanne Wilke, is experienced and holds strong backgrounds in the field.

The company's Phase IIb results are expected in April 2017, with encouraging anecdotal evidence from patients in the trial. If successful, the market size for Bryostatin-1 could be significant, given the high burden of AD and lack of effective treatments.

NTRP's low cash burn rate relative to competitors and the potential market size for Bryostatin-1 suggest a high upside for the stock. A DCF analysis estimates a target price of $45.02, implying a 142% upside. Further, a comparison with similar companies and industry experts' opinions on Bryostatin-1's mechanism of action suggest a fair value significantly higher than the current share price.

Investors are advised to consider the high risk associated with AD drug development but the potential for a substantial payout if NTRP's Phase IIb results are positive. The company's uplisting to NASDAQ, strong management team, and unique drug candidate make it an attractive investment opportunity with long-term potential."
