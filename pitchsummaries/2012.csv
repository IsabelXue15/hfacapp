Questions?"
Kevin__CTO__SIR.pdf,"Consolidated-Tomoka Land (CTO) is a real estate operator founded over 100 years ago. The company holds Florida land at historical low prices on its books. The thesis is to sell the land using a like-kind exchange rule to defer income taxes on capital gains and reinvest 100% of the net sales into income-producing properties. This tax-free monetization of undervalued hard assets by talented management offers an asymmetric risk-reward with near-term catalysts.

The company's assets include income properties and a land portfolio with parcels located in different areas around Florida. The financial overview includes capitalization details, shares outstanding, market cap, net income, EBITDA, and other key financial metrics. The income statement shows revenue, cost of revenue, gross profit, EBIT, EBITDA, net income, and margins for the years 2011-2013.

The key assets of CTO include a close analysis of its land and income properties, management diligence, valuation, risks, and mitigants, and catalysts for growth. The company's management team is shareholder-friendly, experienced in real estate, and committed to unlocking value for shareholders. The valuation analysis includes net asset valuation scenarios based on income properties, raw land prices, and other assets.

The mispricing of CTO is attributed to its complicated segmental structure with hidden assets, a lack of natural buyers, and investor impatience. Risks related to rising interest rates, management execution, and discount rate are identified along with mitigants. Catalysts for growth include smart management, a long-term activist stake, and potential REIT conversion.

The appendix provides consolidated financials, an explanation of like-kind exchange and deferred taxes in REIT conversion, improving income-property portfolio, commercial loan portfolio, golf operations, and subsurface interests in oil exploration. Imminent catalysts include developments with Minto Communities and potential rezoning and development plans."
Trent__USAK__SIR.pdf,"Recommendation: Buy

USA Truck (NASDAQ: USAK) is a company specializing in medium to long haul freight and is the 29th largest trucking company in the nation. The company operates in two business segments: Trucking and Logistics/Strategic Capacity Solutions (SCS). The trucking segment struggled from 2005-2013, but the SCS segment has performed well, although its growth has been overshadowed by the trucking segment.

The company has historically had poor management, making questionable decisions in buying and selling assets. However, since 2013, the company has made strides in improving its operations. The trucking business operates as a freight brokerage, providing cost-effective transportation solutions to clients. The SCS business has shown promise in cutting costs and improving efficiency, with potential for growth.

USA Truck's turnaround progress includes initiatives to reduce costs, improve fuel efficiency, and increase profitability. Activist hedge funds have shown interest in the company, indicating potential for shareholder value creation. The company's valuation is considered undervalued due to past mismanagement, but there is potential for growth if the turnaround continues successfully.

Overall, USA Truck presents a buying opportunity for investors, with potential catalysts for value creation and a clear path to success in its operations."
Chodan__WDC__SIR.pdf,"Stock: Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ: WDC)
Current Price: $64.15 (10/3/13 Closing)
Target Price: $86.58
Recommendation: Buy

Thesis:
We believe that WDC is undervalued due to the misconception that its success is solely tied to the declining PC market. However, WDC has been adapting to changing demands and is set to see growth in non-PC hard drive markets. With excess factory capacity, WDC can maintain or increase margins as demand grows.

Company Background:
WDC is a leading developer and manufacturer of storage solutions under HGST, WD, and G-Technology brands. They hold a 45% market share in Hard Drive Shipments and operate in 4 segments: Client, Enterprise and Cloud, Branded Products, and Consumer Electronics.

Industry / Key Developments:
The storage industry is cyclical, with hard drives being the primary storage medium. While revenue from PC HDDs is projected to decline, growth is expected in the enterprise HDD market as cloud-based storage becomes more prevalent.

Explanation of Thesis:
WDC's value lies in its ability to adapt to changing markets and shift focus to lucrative segments. The company's acquisitions and developments in enterprise storage, such as helium-filled hard drives, are expected to drive growth and increase margins.

Valuation:
Key statistics for WDC include a Market Cap of $15.09B, P/E ratio of 16, and ROIC of 40%. Valuation assumptions are based on projected industry unit shipments and market shares.

Key Risks:
Challenges for WDC include a highly competitive industry, concentrated customer base, and risks associated with acquisitions not yielding expected returns.

Potential Catalysts:
Catalysts for WDC include a shift to the enterprise market, technological advancements like helium-filled drives, and potential favorable rulings that could increase efficiency and drive share prices up.

Thesis Summary:
WDC is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for storage solutions in non-PC markets. As the company focuses more on enterprise storage and innovative technologies, its value is likely to be recognized by investors, leading to potential growth in margins and share prices."
Connor__INFU__SIR.pdf,"InfuSystem (INFU) is a company that provides infusion pumps and related services to oncology clinics in the U.S. and Canada. They have also seen growth in revenue in recent years, but were hindered by incompetent management. Activist investors, including Ryan Morris of Meson Capital Partners, have worked to improve the company's performance.

The company has been making significant changes, such as cutting costs by eliminating irregular board compensation and improving the efficiency of their subsidiary, First Biomed. They have also seen improvements in profitability and cost reduction, leading to their first quarterly profit since 2010.

In terms of valuation, INFU has historically averaged between 6-8X EBITDA multiple over the last three years. The market is currently implying a $10 million EBITDA run-rate, which may be undervalued considering recent improvements and potential for more cost-cutting.

There are risks involved, such as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts and the impact of the generic drug Xeloda on INFU's market share. However, the company is in a unique niche and is the low-cost provider, making it less likely to be significantly affected by these risks.

Overall, INFU presents an exciting special situation opportunity for investors to follow the lead of successful activist investors. The company has a strong business model with high margins and network effects, and recent improvements suggest that it may be significantly undervalued in the market."
Connor__NobleRomans__SIR.pdf,"Summary:
Noble Roman's, a pizza business headquartered in Indiana, began as a small pizza operator in 1972. Over the years, they transitioned into a franchising and supply chain pizza business model. In 2008, the company faced a lawsuit from former franchisees accusing them of fraud, which resulted in legal battles. Currently, the company operates traditional franchises, non-traditional locations, and take-and-bake outlets. The stock is currently trading at $0.73 with a market cap of $14.5M. A conservative discounted cash flow analysis suggests a potential upside of 46% with a target price of $1.13. Major catalysts for potential growth include expected legal payments of $5M, expansion in the take-and-bake market, and improvements in capital structure. However, potential risks include legal liabilities, management missteps, and overly aggressive growth estimates for grocery stores. 

In conclusion, investing in Noble Roman's at the current price may present an opportunity to buy a good business at a great price, with potential for significant upside if catalysts for growth materialize."
NA___ORIG__SIR.pdf,"Ocean Rig (ORIG) is recommended as a buy with a price target of $24, while the current price per share (PPS) is $16. The market cap is $2.16 billion with an enterprise value (EV) of $4.77 billion.

Thesis Summary:
Ocean Rig is seen as an undervalued stock in a misunderstood industry due to factors such as underappreciated earnings power, lack of trust in management, and a dominant forced seller (parent company). The stock is expected to be rerated to trade in line with industry peers as profitability becomes evident and management returns cash to shareholders.

Industry Overview:
Ultra-Deepwater (UDW) drilling operates at ocean depths of 5000+ feet with two types of rigs: Semi-Submersible Platforms and Drillships. The market currently consists of 50 semi-submersibles and 62 drillships, with 80 more ships on the way.

How it works:
Companies like Ocean Rig buy drillships and charter them to oil companies with compensation measured in ""day rates"" directly tied to a company's revenue.

Current Market Conditions:
The market is favorable for rig owners with high day rates, insufficient supply to meet demand, long-term contracts, and cheaper drillships.

Long Term Prospects:
Day rates move with oil prices but are not a one-to-one relationship. Building drillships is attractive with potential for significant profit.

Comps Analysis:
Ocean Rig appears undervalued on an asset basis but overvalued on an EBITDA basis for TTM. It has a substantial operating advantage relative to peers.

Management Risk:
Concerns regarding George Economou's reputation and actions are present, but management risk may be overblown.

Investment Thesis:
Solidly undervalued company in a strong industry with management risk potentially overblown. The institution of a dividend or MLP setup is a strong catalyst for rerating shares. A target price of $24 is projected, reflecting a 50% upside.

Overall, Ocean Rig is positioned well within the industry, despite some risks related to management, and offers significant upside potential for investors."
NA__AUXO__SIR.pdf,"Ticker: AUXO
Recommendation: Buy
Current Price: $1.00
Target Price: $1.50

AUXO is a company with negative tangible book value, declining margins, a $20 million market cap, 0 years of profitability, a working capital shortage, and a history of dilutive financing. Its net income has been consistently negative over the years. The market sees AUXO as having no profitability, a risky business model, pathetic gross margins, and no downside protection.

Auxilio is a provider of vendor-neutral, managed print services to hospitals. It signs hospitals on long-term contracts with guaranteed cost savings and targets 20-25% gross margins after a year. The pros of its business model include being sticky, specialized, differentiated, and offering a cost advantage. However, cons include difficulties in convincing hospitals to switch providers and high set-up costs.

AUXO has experienced massive growth since 2010, with substantial sales momentum and an increase in the number of hospitals served. The company's business model features flat/negative gross margins initially, which improve over time. Valuing AUXO is challenging due to the lumpy nature of new contracts and significant one-time costs affecting operating results.

In a no-growth scenario for 2014, AUXO's implied valuation is $19.42 million. This does not include substantial NOLs and potential profits from 2013. In a base case for 2017, the company's net income is projected to reach $5.6 million. A bull case suggests significant growth potential with the opportunity to generate $20 million in EBITDA per year.

Risks for AUXO include declining print volumes, loss of customers to competitors, and the inability to hit savings targets. Catalysts for the company include recent contract wins with major Catholic hospital chains, profitability expected in 2013, and potential uplisting. Continued execution may prolong the mispricing of AUXO."

NA__STRP__SIR.pdf,"Summary:
Straight Path Communications Inc. (STRP) is a microcap spinoff from IDT Corporation with a market cap of $61 million and an enterprise value of $46 million. The current price is $5.38 with a target price of $9.58. The company owns a significant portion of the nation's wireless spectrum in the 39 GHz frequency and a collection of patents related to communications over the Internet.

The patents held by STRP have provided substantial downside protection for the stock through licensing and litigation efforts. The company has successfully settled patent infringement cases with various companies and has partnered with top law firms for litigation. The patents are estimated to be valued between $12.7 million to $88.7 million, which is more than the entire enterprise value of the company.

In terms of spectrum technology, STRP's spectrum assets are positioned to benefit from the growth of small cells in mobile communication. The company holds licenses for the 39 GHz frequency, making it attractive for wireless backhaul solutions. The potential revenue from small cell deployment could range from $8.4 million to $46 million in 2016, leading to high-margin profits for STRP.

Overall, the sum-of-the-parts valuation for STRP suggests a total value between $52.7 million to $599 million, with a fair value per share of $9.58 representing a 79.1% upside from the current price. The risks associated with the investment include uncertainties in patent validity, small cell deployment, and potential misuse of minority shareholder interests. However, the strong risk/reward profile and the backing of reputable entities like Kirkland & Ellis and Howard Jonas make STRP an attractive investment opportunity."
Connor__REGIS__SIR.pdf,"Summary:
1. Regis Corporation is a recession-resistant business with a market cap of $974.51 million, trading at $17.71 per share, and has a 3-month average volume of 440,000. The company owns, operates, and franchises hairstyling and hair care salons in the U.S. and internationally.
2. Regis is considered cheap relative to its current earnings power, trading at less than 6x EV/EBITDA with a 1.50% dividend yield. Operational improvements are expected, and cost savings are projected by activist firm Starboard Value.
3. Bad management practices have been identified, including excessive compensation for former CEO Paul Finkelstein and related party transactions. Independent analysis has criticized management, leading to shareholder recommendations to withhold votes for three Regis board members.
4. Starboard Value, an activist firm, has filed a 13D and won three positions on Regis' board. They plan to sell non-core operations, cut expenses by $70 million annually, and restore fiduciary duty. This activism is expected to improve operational performance and unlock value for shareholders.
5. Potential cost savings unlocked by Starboard are projected to significantly increase EBITDA and shareholder value. By returning SGA/Rev. to previous levels, Regis could see an increase in EBITDA to $250 million, making it undervalued by 53% - 106%.
6. Considering all factors, Regis is seen as a valuable investment opportunity with significant potential for growth and improved operational performance, making it a strong investment choice."
Greg__RIO__SIR.pdf,"RIO TINTO (RIO) was trading at $74.61 on April 11, 2011, but the current price is $57.58, reflecting a decline of 22.82%. The company has a market cap of $107.2 billion, a PE ratio of 19.55 (previously 9.99), and a debt/equity ratio of 26.5 (previously 22).

The reason for the pitch on RIO was to bet on the global economy assuming an economic recovery. The company has a global footprint and faces industry-related risks that are non-firm specific, causing fluctuations in its share price. Factors such as the strong Canadian and Australian dollar against the USD negatively impact earnings, and economic and commodity uncertainty create volatility.

Recent concerns for RIO include a slowdown in China's GDP growth, as the company is heavily dependent on China (30.7%). Additionally, RIO is still highly reliant on iron ore (60%), faces fierce competition with the Glencore and Xstrata merger, and is seeing new competitors entering the field. African Minerals' share price has increased by 25%, OneSteel in Australia is switching to iron ore from steel, adding to the challenges faced by RIO.

Recommendations for RIO include selling the stock due to high flux in the commodities market, new competitors entering the field, and expectations of a slowdown in the Chinese economy. These factors suggest that RIO may face further challenges in the near future."
Ian__Teva__SIR.pdf,"Daniel Norton and Ian Townsend presented a detailed analysis of Teva, an Israeli pharmaceutical company, at the Harvard Financial Analysts Club on April 12, 2012. Teva operates in three major divisions within the pharmaceutical industry - production of generic drugs and therapies, research, development, and production of proprietary drugs, and production and distribution of active pharmaceutical ingredients. In 2011, Teva's revenue breakdown showed 56% from generic products, 35% from proprietary products like Copaxone, Azilect, and other treatments, and the rest from active pharmaceutical ingredients.

The presentation highlighted Teva's major products like Copaxone for multiple sclerosis, Provigil, Nuvigil, Plan B One-Step, Azilect, ParaGard, and Treanda. Teva's revenue growth and potential for investors in Israel were discussed, with a focus on R&D investment and market expansion into Russia, Latin America, and Asia. The company's acquisition strategy and revenue projections for 2012 were also analyzed.

The analysts recommended buying Teva stock for long-term hold, predicting price appreciation due to new generic products and revenue growth. The presentation included financial comparisons with other pharmaceutical companies like Mylan Inc. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, as well as revenue growth rate and exit multiple projections. The average analyst price target for Teva was $52.41, with conservative, moderate, and generous price estimates provided as well."
Jared__AxiaNetMedia__SIR.pdf,"Summary of Axia Netmedia, Inc.: 

Axia Netmedia, Inc. is an operating model that focuses on Next Generation Network Solutions. The company owns and operates networks, with data provided by external sources. They earn fees based on bandwidth usage. Their networks are often built with government support to lower costs for consumers. Deployments include Alberta, France, Western Massachusetts, Spain, and Singapore, with $2 billion invested so far and 30,000 km of fiber. There has been a 48% bandwidth usage growth year over year. 

The balance sheet shows opportunities in Europe and Singapore. The valuation indicates a Price to Book ratio of less than 1, a premium to net tangible assets of 2-3%, and a NPV of roughly $31 million based on current revenue assuming no new investment. The company trades at roughly 3X EBITDA with a similar EV/EBITDA. Despite being undervalued, Axia's low volume, little investor interest, lack of flashiness, doubts about expansion potential, and major investments yet to become profitable contribute to its low market perception. 

The recommendation is to buy AXX.TO as a long-term hold with a target price of $2.50, over 60% above current levels, with a plan to reevaluate later for potential profit."

JaredConnor__Reading__SIR.pdf,"Reading International (RDI) is currently undervalued as it is perceived as a cinema operator, but the majority of its value actually lies in its real estate holdings. With a stock price of $4.63, which is 86% of its book value, investors have significant downside protection and over 100% upside potential.

RDI operates 57 cinemas, 471 screens, and four live theaters, generating stable operating income of about $20 million per year. Its real estate holdings include retail developments around modern multiplexes and prime real estate occupied by legacy theaters. Less than 10% of owned real estate is developed, presenting an opportunity for growth.

Compared to other cinema operators like MCS, RGC, CKEC, and CNK, RDI is undervalued based on its EV/EBITDA and P/B ratios. RDI's real estate component includes motels, legacy theaters, retail developments, undeveloped land, and a total of 16.5 million sq. ft. of real estate with only 1.2 million sq. ft. developed.

Valuation methodologies suggest that RDI could eliminate all of its debt by selling off its real estate portfolio, resulting in a significant increase in equity value per share. Catalysts for RDI include the sale or development of its real estate portfolio, with potential land sales and redevelopment projects in the works.

Risks for RDI include competition from substitutes like Netflix, exchange rate risks, and being controlled by one individual due to a two-tiered stock structure. However, the unique business model, eclectic real estate portfolio, and lack of sell-side coverage present an opportunity for investors to buy into a cinema operator and gain access to $185 million in real estate value for free. With minimal downside and over 100% upside potential, RDI is a compelling investment opportunity."

N_A__BestBuy__SIR.pdf,"Summary:

On 4/12/2012, the pitch for Best Buy (BBY) was to hold the stock. The investor had bought 88 shares at $28.33, but the current trading price was $22.24 (after hours $22.29), resulting in a loss of -21.50% over the course of one year. The stock was trading around support at $22.12.

Reasons to Hold:
1. Best Buy is a steady dividend stock, paying $0.15 - $0.16 every quarter, which is better than just holding the money in cash.
2. The stock is trading around support at around $22.
3. The CEO recently stepped down, and the company is looking for a new CEO.
4. The GAAP loss was due to various factors such as purchasing CPW's stake in Best Buy Mobile, restructuring costs, and goodwill impairment from BBY Europe.
5. Fiscal FCF for 2012 was $2.5 billion, indicating financial stability.
6. There is potential for growth as Best Buy is seeing growth in sales of big items, increasing shipping costs, growing the online business, and closing 50 stores to shift towards Best Buy Mobile. 

Overall, the recommendation was to hold Best Buy stock due to its dividend payments, potential for growth, and trading around support levels."
N_A__Gravity__SIR.pdf,"Summary:
Gravity Corp (GRVY) is a company that develops and publishes online games, with their main revenue source being Ragnarok Online. The long-awaited sequel, Ragnarok Online II, is set to be released soon, which is expected to significantly impact the company's value. The market is currently undervaluing the potential of RO2, providing an opportunity for potential growth. The company's financial data and valuation indicate upside potential, with a price target ranging from $3.43 to $10. However, there are risks involved due to the majority stake purchase by Gungho Entertainment Group, which controls the board of Gravity. Despite these risks, there is a rare opportunity to participate in potential explosive upside while being protected by substantial assets on the balance sheet."
N_A__Xinyuan__PDF.pdf,"Xinyuan Real Estate (XIN) is a real estate developer in China that focuses on Tier 2 and 3 cities. Founded in the late 1990s, the company purchases land from the Chinese government to develop high-rise housing projects. Despite concerns about fraud and the Chinese housing bubble, XIN is considered a buy recommendation with a current price of $2.82 and a target price of $4.20.

XIN is not considered a fraud due to its IPO process, reputable auditor (Ernst & Young), and credible CFO. The company has reported quarters that missed expectations, pays dividends, and engages in shareholder-friendly practices. In terms of the housing bubble, XIN is insulated from rapid price increases and has a large cash reserve to purchase land when prices fall.

The company's ability to capitalize on lower land prices, increasing demand, and stable gross margins show that it may weather the housing bubble better than expected. With a net cash position equal to its market cap, XIN is considered undervalued and has the potential for significant growth. The company's net tangible assets and earnings potential suggest a valuation of $4.20 per share or higher, representing a significant upside from the current price."

NA__InternetPatents__SIR.pdf,"Internet Patents Corporation (PTNT) - Sell Pitch 2/19/2012

- Why Sell?
Currently sitting on a small approximately 1% gain.
The thesis has changed and the stock is fairly valued.
The original thesis was that their asset sale of Bankrate.com (essentially their entire operations) would lead to a larger than cash balance. The sale did go through and it popped on the news.
However, they incurred larger than expected taxes in the transaction, which for the small company means our margin of error has been reduced.
After employee options are exercised, diluting current shareholders, we will be owning a company slightly below cash running a patent-licensing business that will likely burn cash for at least 12 months.
Lock in a small gain (albeit over a short time period) and allocate the funds elsewhere. There are too many good ideas out there to keep cash in PTNT."
