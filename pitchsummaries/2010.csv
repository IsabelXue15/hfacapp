Fed Rate Speculation:
- Reasons for the Fed to raise rates include a recovering economy, positive indicators, and inflationary fears.
- Reasons against a rate hike include a still weak economy, Fed's commitment to low rates, possibility of a double-dip, and confidence in preventing inflation by draining reserves.
