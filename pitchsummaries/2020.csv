Despite recent events resulting from the Coronavirus, CORR remains an interesting case study in REITs and equities due to its unique assets and strong balance sheet. Currently 45% down due to a large tenant (47% of revenue in 2019) would suspend rent payments in addition to cutting dividend payments by about 90%. Steep drop in oil demand due to stay-at-home policies in addition to original price war led Cox Oil to shut down production in the Gulf of Mexico and cease payments beginning in April. Despite this, they continue to have an extremely strong balance sheet with nearly enough cash to cover their total debts (Cash/Debt = 0.77) along with a very low D/E ratio (0.4756).

Overview
CORR finds itself in a competitive landscape characterized by high barriers to entry and established partnerships composing a diverse network effect surrounding the industry.

General Background
REITs, such as mutual funds, use the pooled capital of many investors to directly invest in income-yielding properties. To qualify as a REIT, a company or trust must distribute at least 90.0% of its taxable income to shareholders annually. Income is largely generated from rent, interest, and capital gains. Assets under each firm’s investments constitute a large source of revenue for these firms, as expansion in oil and energy services through the U.S. depends on transportation and other labor-intensive fields as well. Economies of scale are at play here, as the larger the coverage of services provided and asset classes possessed, the more valuable the overall trust. With an increased scrutiny surrounding traditional fossil fuels and oil consumption, a fervor to invest in novel, cleaner forms of energy production has surged across the industry. CORR is a Real Estate Investing Trust focused on energy infrastructure such as pipelines, offshore platforms, energy transmission lines, and storage terminals.

Business Overview
Despite trends towards sustainable energy, fossil fuels still provide 63% of US energy needs. The US consumes about 75% of its oil from local sources. Pipelines provide essential infrastructure in the supply chain for these products. Required to distribute 90% of taxable income as dividends. Considered relatively stable in general, real estate as an asset is stable and grows steadily but provides little to no liquidity, REITs on the other hand come with stable growth and liquidity. REITs and CORR provide valuable diversification to portfolios by creating investment opportunities in infrastructure real estate. Most other pipeline investments are in subsidiaries of large corporations, much less flexible than CORR. CORR is an attractive asset to most or all portfolios due to its exposure to oil and gas markets, REIT financial structure, and flexibility in its industry space.

Key Assets
- Pinedale Liquids Gathering System: Located in Wyoming, 150+ miles of pipeline, with 107 receipt points and four central storage facilities.
- Grand Isle Gathering System: 153 miles of undersea pipeline that transports oil and water for ExxonMobil in the Gulf of Mexico.
- MoGas Pipeline: 263-mile interstate natural gas pipeline system that spans Missouri and Illinois.
- Omega Pipeline: Based in Missouri, owns and operates a natural gas distribution system.

Historical Asset Exit Strategies
- Portland Terminal Facility: Acquired in 01/2014 and sold in 12/2018.
- Eastern Interconnect Project: Extensive electrical grid that moved electricity across New Mexico, sold to New Mexico state government in 04/2015.

Competitor Analysis
- Hannon Armstrong (HASI): Renewable power and energy efficiency investor.
- Landmark Infrastructure (LMRK): Focus on renewable energy resources.

Investment Thesis
CORR has significant cash reserves and relatively low debt, meaning that its prospects for emerging from the pandemic intact looked quite promising. CORR’s revenues and dividend remained consistent regardless of prior fluctuations in oil prices.

Thesis Point 1: Healthy Financials
CORR has shown reliability and even robust growth despite a volatile oil market, with a consistent dividend rewarding investors along the way.

Thesis Point 2: Historical Stability
CORR’s proven resilience in macroeconomic hardship and relationship with investors made them seem like an appealing choice in a recession.

Thesis Point 3: Protected Assets
CORR’s unique business model means that its assets are protected against the coronavirus outbreak and will continue to generate stable revenues in the long-term.

Catalysts
CORR’s foundations make it perfectly positioned to capitalize on any sign of recovery from the current economic recession.

What Went Wrong
Recent events such as dividend cuts and rent payment suspensions have changed the perspective on CORR’s value and financial stability.

Scenario Projections
The bear case has been adjusted to represent a somewhat conservative base case, and the bull case remains the same as the case projected prior to 4/13.

In conclusion, despite recent setbacks, CORR still presents an interesting case study in REITs and equities, with its unique assets, strong balance sheet, and potential for growth in the future."

Tufin was founded in 2005 to help companies establish a unified security policy across their IT infrastructure from on-premise to Public Cloud. Over the past year, Tufin has shown a general downward trend, notably dipping when missing its Q4 predicted estimates. Volatility in TUFN’s stock price is inevitable given their contract-based approach. Negative profit and cash flow make investors wary of optimistic predictions for Tufin.

Overview
Tufin Technologies has established themselves as a trusted player in a quickly growing industry with plenty of unrealized potential.

Business Overview
- Builds management software to help companies adapt to changing landscape of data security
- Helps companies automatically update and manage security policies, fire walls, and cloud and network infrastructure
- Fulfills ideal balance between speed and security of operations when working with sensitive information
- Helps bridge the gap between current technologies and the AI, machine learning, and other advanced tools
- Founded in 2006 by Ruvi Kitov and Reuven Harrison from Israeli security company Check Point
- Was almost entirely self-funded by growing revenue streams until its IPO in 2019
- Rapid growth of cybersecurity industry has driven market demand
- Increased regulatory action has expanded clients’ needs in the security space
- Operates at near zero profits and with little debt, despite incredible growth rate
- Has gained trusted clients, including Apple, JPMorgan, and Coca-Cola, for implementation
- First-mover advantage has established Tufin as a reliable cybersecurity partner
- Experienced management team able to attract new clients with competitive, superior services
- Understanding client complaints leads to direct improvements in ever-expanding product line
- Scalable and efficient solutions have attracted key players in the market

MARKET NICHE
Tufin’s products are targeted towards facilitating corporations’ transitions to better data security practices. The cybersecurity industry faces abundant opportunities for growth as governmental policies and consumers’ concerns continue to surround data privacy.

Industry Overview
With increasingly complicated networks connecting both on-site and cloud-based computing devices, companies struggle to find an efficient solution to reconcile the two systems. Recent scandals, such as those involving Cambridge Analytica and Equifax, expose to consumers the dangers of trusting corporations with their private information. Governments across the globe have begun to focus on cybersecurity, with Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation doling out significant fines for rule violations.

Competitor Analysis
Some of Tufin’s competitors, AlgoSec and FireMon, have been vying for market share, but Tufin’s integrated offerings and established customer base allow it to remain dominant.

Investment Thesis
Due to its advantageous position in a promising industry and its unique competitive advantages, Tufin technologies is poised for long-term growth. Tufin’s main revenue streams are contracts and maintenance, which leads to unstable quarter-to-quarter revenue growth, leading to the market undervaluing the company. Compounding upon the hypersensitive market, Tufin’s recent failures to execute on deals and missed earnings have caused share prices to plummet, even though these events don’t reflect true growth potential. The cybersecurity market is set to expand quickly, and Tufin’s strong financials and strategic positioning will allow it to capitalize on these new opportunities. Tufin’s new SecureCloud product “combines and extends” features from the company’s previous offerings, cementing Tufin’s position as the ”first and only vendor” to integrate security management across platforms.

Thesis Point 1: Hypersensitive Market
Tufin Technologies operates utilizing a model of contract and maintenance. The stock market overreacts to any downturn in Tufin’s revenue growth, but their contract model indicates that growth is necessarily bumpy.

Thesis Point 2: Market Overreaction
After a missed earnings report this past quarter, TUFN has been trading low despite strong financials and recent change in management.

Thesis Point 3: Strong Market Presence
Contains some risk in terms of a changing market space and possible surprises from competitors.

Thesis Point 4: SecureCloud
TUFN’s newest product, SecureCloud reported its first customer in 4Q with a six figure subscriber.

Catalysts
Much of Tufin’s share price decline can be attributed to missing expectations, so a few quarters of hitting earnings will reaffirm the company’s growth potential in the eyes of the market. As Tufin continues to release new SaaS products, quick adoption could lead to a spiral effect of improving reputation while also allowing them to reduce SG&A expenses. If Tufin maintains its dominant position amongst competitors, the market will likely be more to view Tufin as a leader in the expanding industry, allowing for more natural growth potential.

Possible Risks to Thesis
Companies may not utilize traditional firewall technology even in a virtual mode as they do on premise. Faster than expected move to the cloud without further traction in these products could lead to a deterioration in the growth outlook. New products have seen little market acceptance so far. License and maintenance business contract model in software creates greater lumpiness in revenue, increasing the chance that quarterly estimates miss expectations.

Overall, Tufin’s position in the cybersecurity industry, combined with its strategic advantages and growth potential, makes it an attractive investment opportunity with the potential for long-term growth."

Jordan__Covetrus__SIR.pdf,"**Covetrus, Inc. (NASDAQ: CVET) Detailed Summary**

**Company Overview**
Covetrus is a global technology-enabled animal health business that provides a service and technology platform along with a supply chain to improve veterinary care.

**Industry Overview**
Covetrus operates in the growing Animal Health sector, which has shown stable annual growth rates of 5-7% over the past 12 years.

Competition in the industry includes traditional drug companies, manufacturers selling directly to vets, and online pet pharmacy services.

**Historical Financials**
The investment thesis for Covetrus includes the market not fully pricing in the potential of the Vet's First business, the opportunity for cross-selling through its global distribution network, and potential margin growth. Risks to the investment thesis include competition from online distributors, supplier consolidation, and increased SG&A costs.

The company is a contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) that focuses on biopharmaceutical products derived from mammalian cell cultures. Avid closed its R&D segment in 2017/2018 to focus on customer needs, leading to negative revenue from 2017 to 2019.

Despite historically volatile cash flows and the recent shutdown of its R&D arms, Avid is seen as a small drug manufacturer with potential for growth in a rapidly consolidating industry. The CDMO industry was valued at $150.66 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $246.24 billion by 2025. Demand for pharmaceutical products has increased, leading to the expansion of manufacturing capabilities by pharma/biotech companies. Avid faces risks such as high switching costs, historical losses, reliance on key clients, and success depending on its customers' products being approved and profitable.

Avid's decision to close its R&D segment is expected to reduce expenses and appeal to prospective clients. The company's expenses are largely fixed costs, and as Avid attracts more customers and grows contracts, positive cash flows are anticipated. Avid's focus on small and mid-sized pharmaceutical companies, who are responsible for a majority of drug output, gives it a competitive edge. The company's growth strategy includes investment in facilities and technology, expansion of the customer base, and improved regulatory and quality track record.

In terms of key financials, the company experienced a 33% drop in share price at the end of January due to lower Q2 2020 hardware sales, as its biggest customer underwent acquisition. However, there was an increase in Q2 sell-through from distributor to alarm and lock dealers. The recent sell-off due to the coronavirus also contributed to further declines in the share price.

NAPCO Security Technologies is unique as it is the sole provider of security products across alarms, connectivity, locking, and access control. The company offers unique integration opportunities and convenience for customers through its Fusion Technology Systems platform. With a focus on both hardware and software, NAPCO is positioned for growth in the physical security industry.

The company's investment thesis includes recurring revenue through its StarLink cellular communication segment, increased demand for school security solutions, and strong new product offerings. NAPCO's strong market position, innovative products, and solid financials make it an attractive investment opportunity.

However, there are risks involved, such as extended payment terms granted to some customers and competition from DIY alarm products. Mitigants include a strong network of distributors and the company's focus on B2B sales.

Upcoming catalysts for NAPCO Security Technologies include the Q3 earnings report, launch of new products, and share buybacks. The company's commitment to creating shareholder value and its alignment of interests with shareholders make it a promising investment option."

Todd_WeightWatchers__SIR.pdf,"Weight Watchers (NYSE: WW) is a US wellness company and the leading weight-management services provider, operating in most developed economies. The company offers three program options: Digital App, Workshop + Digital, and Personal Coaching + Digital. In September 2018, WW rebranded to ""WW"" to focus on overall health and wellness, moving away from just weight loss.

Selected financials show that WW's market capitalization is $1,277.4 million, with a total enterprise value of $2,858.1 million. The company's revenue has fluctuated over the years, with a decline in 2019. WW has faced challenges with its rebranding efforts and criticisms for the shift in focus.

The industry overview highlights the broad Total Addressable Market (TAM) in the global health & wellness market, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.9%. WW's Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) in the US Weight Loss Market is estimated to be worth $18 billion.

WW's product offerings have been recognized as the ""Best Diet for Weight Loss"" and ""Best Commercial Diet"" for 10 consecutive years. The company offers digital subscriptions, studio+digital packages, and in-workshop product sales.

The investment thesis for WW includes a differentiated view on Oprah's Vision Tour driving subscriber growth and the impact of COVID-19 increasing interest in health and wellness. The company's high operating leverage, CLTV/CAC of 4.4x, and historical average of 21% ROIC support a positive outlook.

The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the impact of Oprah's Vision Tour and COVID-19 on WW's business show potential for subscriber growth and market share capture. The company's high operating leverage and CLTV/CAC ratio contribute to its strong financial performance.

A conservative model assumes WW will outperform consensus sales estimates by 10% and experience a modest multiple revaluation. Valuation and liquidity risk evaluations indicate that WW has sufficient cash on hand and credit facilities to meet its financial obligations.

In conclusion, WW faces challenges with its rebranding efforts but has potential for growth through Oprah's Vision Tour and increased health consciousness due to COVID-19. The company's strong financial position and product offerings position it well in the weight-management services market."
