Pitch,Summary
Q2 2008 Stock Profiles_[Same Companies].pdf,"ARM Holdings plc (ADR) (NASDAQ: ARMH) is a British semiconductor company that trades on the NASDAQ through its American Depository Shares (ADS). The company is well-known for its processors and also designs, licenses, and sells software development tools, systems, and platforms. As a designer of these components, ARM Holdings faces risks due to its reliance on a few major manufacturers for success and potential litigation threats due to its IP-centric business.

In the second quarter, ARM Holdings faced challenges entering into new licensing agreements due to prevailing market conditions. However, the company saw record-high royalty revenues, indicating growth in sales of products containing ARM-licensed technology. They are cutting operating expenses and restructuring to increase profitability. Litigation with rival Technology Properties Limited, Inc. was resolved positively, reducing future risk.

Avalon Holdings Corporation (AMEX: AWX) is an Ohio-based waste management services provider with three golf courses. They had a poor Q2, with declining stock prices, and questions about management's plans due to cash spent on golf courses with little results. Expenses were up, affecting profitability. Avalon is running out of cash, which could impact their future plans.

Melco Crown Entertainment Limited is a casino-based resort developer in Macau, China. Their Crown Macau casino saw strong growth, leading to the company's first profitable quarter. Melco is poised for future growth, with new projects in development.

Companhia Paranaense de Energia - Copel (NYSE: ELP) is a utility company in Brazil with a focus on electricity production. Strong financial results in the second quarter were driven by increased consumption of electricity. The company is expected to benefit from Brazil's plans for hydroelectric infrastructure development.

Cumulus Media Inc. (CMLS) saw a decline in earnings and revenue in Q2 due to weakening demand in the radio industry. The merger deal fell through, but the termination fee boosted net income. HFAC will monitor Cumulus' performance and consider a position based on industry trends.

Overall, various companies like Western Digital, Northstar Realty Finance, and GSK are facing challenges and opportunities in their respective industries. Monitoring their performance and industry trends will be crucial for making informed investment decisions. Nike, with its strong brand and overseas growth potential, continues to show promise despite challenges in the U.S. market. Myers Industries faces challenges after a failed privatization offer, and HFAC will need to reevaluate its position in the company."
