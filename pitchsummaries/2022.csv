Asher__Netflix__SIR.pdf,"Netflix Investment Recommendation: BUY Asher Noel

Thesis:
- Netflix is currently at a 19% FX-neutral TTM operating margin and 27 P/E, with approximately $30B TTM revenue, $14B gross debt, and $6B cash. It is recommended to buy Netflix due to 1) ads rollout, 2) account sharing crackdown, and 3) market participants realizing they are #1 in a winner takes all market.
  
o Ads rollout doubling net income with ~$6B in incremental revenue: By introducing ads at $40 CPM’s, with 2 hours of viewing per day per account and 5-10 ads per hour, and assuming 20M of Netflix’s subscriber base watching ads, there would be an incremental revenue of $5.84B. Over 80% could be expected to be net income, which would almost double net income, potentially decreasing P/E to 14 and suggesting a potential for at least 100% near-term price appreciation.

o Account sharing increasing revenue by another 10%, or $3B in net income: Account sharing in LATAM increased ARPU by 20%. Assuming a conservative 10% increase in revenue from the rest of the world, overall revenue should increase by about 10%, with most trickling down to net income.

o #1 in a winner takes all market: Netflix is the clear category leader in time spent and subscribers. With fixed costs for shows, Netflix offers the most content per consumer subscription dollar. As competitors raise prices and Netflix monetizes its higher viewing with ads, the market is expected to recognize Netflix as the insurmountable #1 player deserving of a much higher multiple than previously given (16 P/E).

In conclusion, Netflix is recommended as a buy with the potential for significant growth in the near term based on the three outlined factors."
Asher__SentinelOne__SIR.pdf,"Summary:

Asher Noel, the SIR Director at Sentinel One, Inc., along with SIR Analysts Duke Moon, James McGlinchey, and Justi Heeb, has recommended a long position for the company as of October 20th, 2022. The analysts believe that there is a >2.5x risk/reward opportunity with 23% less growth than the industry average. SentinelOne is seen to be leveraging AI technology to capitalize on the network effect in the cybersecurity industry.

The company, founded in 2013, specializes in extended detection and response (XDR) cybersecurity solutions.

The analysts highlight the market potential for SentinelOne, with the global cybersecurity market expected to grow significantly in the coming years. The rise of container usage and increasing cybercrime activities are seen as catalysts for SentinelOne's growth. The company's strong performance in industry evaluations, such as MITRE Engenuity's ATT&CK, further reinforces their position in the market.

However, there are risks associated with SentinelOne, including the need for stronger AI research productivity, the impact of security breaches on the company's reputation, and concerns about shareholder compensation. The analysts stress the importance of revenue growth as a key driver for valuation and recommend a buy rating for the company with a target price of $27.25."

Kevin__FormulaOne__SIR.pdf,"The Formula One Group (NASDAQ: FWONK) is a UK-based conglomerate company that manages the highest level of international racing, founded in 1950 by Bernie Ecclestone. The company makes money from race promotion fees, broadcasting rights, advertising and sponsorships, and the Paddock club. FWONK stock IPO'd in 2016 and has been steadily growing, with a recent increase of 20% in share price at the start of the new racing season.

F1 has no direct competition and has a very strong moat. The sport has seen increased engagement and viewership, especially with the success of Netflix's show ""Drive to Survive"". F1 is the most watched annual sporting series in the world, with over 525 million viewers. The new Concorde agreement has capped team spending, fostering a more competitive environment.

The US market is experiencing significant growth in F1 viewership and social media trends. ESPN viewership has increased dramatically, and the sport is gaining a new audience rapidly. Netflix's impact through ""Drive to Survive"" has also contributed to the growth of F1 in the US.

FWONK is eyeing a more lucrative US broadcasting deal, as well as global deals trending upward. The company has negotiated a 50/50 split for every dollar earned over a certain threshold, providing significant EBITDA leverage. The Concorde Agreement has introduced budget caps to foster parity and boost viewership.

New management, led by Stefano Domenicali, is focused on rebranding F1 for a new generation, focusing on media and racing revenue, and investor-aligned capital allocation. The company has ramped up its social media presence and is targeting younger demographics for growth.

The stock price has already seen a jump with the start of the 2022 season, and there is significant opportunity for operating leverage given F1's strong moat. Catalysts for growth include aggressive stock buybacks and surpassing quarterly earning expectations.

Risks include difficulties in renewing or replacing contracts and potential competition from other motor sport events. However, F1's strong moat and expansion into new markets mitigate these risks.

Overall, FWONK is at an inflection point of growth, with increasing viewership, revenue, and bottom line expansion. The company's strong position in the market, new management strategy, and potential for future growth make it a compelling investment opportunity."
