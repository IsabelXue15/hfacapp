Kevin__CTO__SIR.pdf,"Summary:
Consolidated-Tomoka Land (CTO) is a real estate operator founded over 100 years ago, with Florida land holdings on the books for historically low prices. The thesis revolves around selling the land using a like-kind exchange rule to defer income taxes on capital gains and reinvesting 100% of the net sales into income-producing properties. The tax-free monetization of undervalued hard assets by talented management offers an asymmetric risk-reward with near-term catalysts. The company's assets include income properties and a land portfolio, with a focus on the potential value of its land holdings.

Financials:
The company has a market cap of $270,159,201 with total assets of $358,128,000. The net asset value ranges from $239,994,000 in a bear scenario to $974,177,000 in a bull scenario. The company's net income has shown growth over the years, with a margin of 14.3% in 2013. The company's valuation is based on the potential value of its income properties and raw land, with a focus on unlocking the true value of its hard assets.

Management:
CTO's management team is highlighted for their experience in the real estate industry, with CEO John Albright having a background in real estate investment and CFO Mark Patten having experience in REITs. The company's shareholder-friendly dynamics, including a 25% stake held by an activist mutual fund, indicate a commitment to value creation.

Risks and Catalysts:
Key risks for CTO include rising interest rates or inflation and management execution. However, potential catalysts for the company include a REIT conversion, development projects in Daytona Beach, and potential land sales. The company's growth drivers in Daytona Beach, such as infrastructure projects and rising home values, also present opportunities for value creation.

Overall, the investment thesis for CTO revolves around unlocking the value of its undervalued assets through strategic land sales, reinvestment in income-producing properties, and potential catalysts that could drive share price appreciation."
Trent__USAK__SIR.pdf,"USA Truck (NASDAQ: USAK) is a trucking company with two main business segments: Trucking and Logistics/Strategic Capacity Solutions (SCS). The Trucking segment struggled from 2005-2013, while the SCS segment has performed well but its growth has been overshadowed by the Trucking segment. USA Truck specializes in medium to long-haul freight and is the 29th largest trucking company in the nation. The company has historically had poor management, but this improved in 2013.

The Trucking segment operates as a freight brokerage business, providing cost-effective transportation solutions to clients. The company leverages its large client base from the Trucking segment. The SCS/Logistics segment has shown progress in turning around the Trucking business by cutting costs and improving efficiency.

USA Truck has made efforts to expand and improve its fleet, reduce turnover, and increase profitability. The company has seen success in certain cost initiatives but still faces challenges with high turnover rates. Activist hedge funds like Stone House Capital and Baker Street Capital have shown interest in the company, adding members to the board.

The valuation of USA Truck is considered undervalued due to its turnaround potential, discounted valuation of the SCS business, and the possibility of a sale of the Trucking segment. The company operates in a challenging industry with low barriers to entry and historical mismanagement. Potential risks include the failure of the turnaround, high turnover rates, and external factors like rising oil costs.

Overall, it is recommended to buy USA Truck (USAK) stock, considering its potential for turnaround and undervaluation in the market."
Chodan__WDC__SIR.pdf,"Stock: Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ: WDC)
Current Price: $64.15 (10/3/13 Closing)
Target Price: $86.58
Recommendation: Buy

Summary:
We recommend buying shares of Western Digital Corporation (WDC) as we believe the stock is undervalued. While many investors associate WDC with the declining PC market, the company is actively adapting to changing hard drive demands and expanding into non-PC markets. WDC holds a leading market share in PC hard drives and is expected to see strong growth in other sectors due to increasing demand for data storage. The company has excess factory capacity, providing an advantage in maintaining or increasing margins as demand rises.

Company Background:
WDC is a top developer and manufacturer of storage solutions under brands like HGST, WD, and G-Technology. Their main product is hard drives with rotating magnetic disks, holding a 45% market share in hard drive shipments.

Industry/Key Developments:
The storage industry is cyclical, with hard drives as the primary storage medium. While revenue from PC hard drives is expected to decline, WDC aims to grow in the enterprise HDD market as cloud-based storage becomes more prevalent.

Explanation of Thesis:
We base our valuation on projected industry unit shipments and WDC's market share. The company's acquisitions, such as HGST, and focus on enterprise drives, indicate a shift away from the PC market. Catalysts include the adoption of advanced technologies like helium-filled hard drives and potential rulings that could increase efficiency and shareholder value.

Valuation:
Key valuation assumptions are based on industry unit shipment projections. Comparative analysis with other companies in the industry shows WDC as undervalued.

Key Risks:
Risks include intense industry competition, a concentrated customer base, and the uncertainty of acquisitions paying off.

Potential Catalysts:
WDC's shift towards enterprise markets and technological advancements are catalysts for growth. A favorable ruling in China could also increase efficiency and shareholder value.

Thesis Summary:
WDC's market leadership and growth potential in non-PC markets make it an attractive investment. As the company transitions to the enterprise segment, margins are expected to improve. With a strong focus on shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends, WDC presents a compelling opportunity for investors."
Connor__INFU__SIR.pdf,"INFUSystem (INFU) is a company founded in 2005 and based in Michigan. They provide infusion pumps and related services to oncology clinics in the U.S. and Canada. The pumps are used in the treatment of various cancers, including colorectal cancer. Payment is obtained through patient insurance or directly from the patient, depending on insurance benefits. INFU has experienced solid revenue growth in recent years, though incompetent management has hindered progress. Activist investors have played a role in reshaping the company, particularly Ryan Morris of Meson Capital Partners. Cost-cutting measures have been implemented, such as eliminating irregular board compensation and better utilizing subsidiary First Biomed. Valuation methodology indicates that the market may be undervaluing INFU, despite recent improvements and potential cost-cutting opportunities. Risks include potential Medicare reimbursement cuts and competition from the generic version of the drug Xeloda. Overall, INFU presents an exciting special situation opportunity with the potential for significant upside."

NA___ORIG__SIR.pdf,"Ocean Rig (ORIG) is recommended as a ""Buy"" with a price target of $24. The current price per share (PPS) is $16, with a market cap of $2.16 billion and an enterprise value (EV) of $4.77 billion.

Thesis Summary:
- Ocean Rig is seen as undervalued in a misunderstood industry due to reasons such as not appreciating its earnings power, lack of trust in management, and being dominated by a forced seller (parent company).
- The stock is expected to be revalued to trade in line with industry peers as profitability becomes apparent and management returns cash to shareholders.

Industry Overview:
- Ultra-Deepwater drilling operates at ocean depths of 5000+ feet with two types of rigs: Semi-Submersible Platforms and Drillships.
- Currently, there are 50 semi-submersibles and 62 drillships, with 80 more ships on the way.

How it works:
- Companies like Ocean Rig buy drillships and charter them to oil companies, with compensation measured in ""day rates"" which are directly tied to a company's revenue.

Current Market Conditions:
- Favorable conditions for rig owners include high day rates, insufficient supply to meet demand, long-term contracts, cheaper drillships, and the need for drilling in areas without shale oil.

Long Term Prospects:
- Day rates move with oil prices, but not in a one-to-one relationship, with the scarcity of onshore oil supplies counteracting a gradual decline in prices.
- Building drillships is attractive with potential Chinese shipbuilders entering the market.

Comps Analysis:
- ORIG appears undervalued on an asset basis but overvalued on an EBITDA basis for the trailing twelve months.
- The company is seen as having a substantial operating advantage compared to its peers.

Investment Thesis:
- ORIG is considered solidly undervalued in a promising industry, with management risk perceived to be overblown.
- The potential institution of a dividend or MLP could significantly rerate the shares, offering a conservative upside of about 50%.

Conclusion:
- Ocean Rig is viewed as a strong investment opportunity with significant upside potential and a target price of $24.
- The company is expected to benefit from favorable industry conditions and operational improvements, potentially leading to a rerating of its shares."
NA__AUXO__SIR.pdf,"Summary of Ticker: AUXO
- Recommendation: Buy
- Current Price: $1.00
- Target Price: $1.50

AUXO is a company with negative tangible book value, declining margins, a $20 million market cap, 0 years of profitability, a working capital shortage, and a history of dilutive financing. The market sees the company as having no profitability, a risky and unproven business model, pathetic gross margins, and no downside protection.

Auxilio is a provider of vendor-neutral, managed print services to hospitals. It signs hospitals on long-term contracts with guaranteed cost savings and targets 20-25% gross margins. The pros of its business model include stickiness, being specialized, differentiated, and vendor-neutral. Cons include difficulty in convincing hospitals to switch providers and high setup costs.

The company has experienced substantial sales growth since 2010, with revenue more than tripling. Its business model features flat/negative gross margins initially, with earnings and margins improving over time. Valuing AUXO is challenging due to the impact of one-time costs, low gross margins, and growth projections.

In a no-growth case for 2014, the implied valuation is $19.42 million. The company's current business roster justifies its current stock price with bearish assumptions. The base case for 2017 projects a net income of $5.6 million. A bull case envisions significant growth potential with 300+ hospitals and $20 million in EBITDA per year.

Risks for AUXO include declining print volumes, loss of customers, and challenges in hitting savings targets. Catalysts for the company include recent contract wins with major Catholic hospital chains, profitability expected in 2013, potential uplisting, and other major contract wins. Continued execution may prolong the mispricing of the stock."

Target Price: $9.58 

STRAIGHT PATH COMMUNICATIONS INC. (STRP) 

STRP is a highly misunderstood security with a fantastic risk/reward, and a potential “heads I make 5X, tails I breakeven” scenario. 

Introduction: 
STRP, a recent microcap spinoff from IDT Corporation, is undervalued and presents a great risk/reward opportunity. Even using conservative valuation estimates for the spectrum and patents, the company appears to be fairly valued. The upside potential in the patents and spectrum assets could lead to significant returns for investors. The target price for STRP is $9.58, representing a 78% upside from the current price of $5.38. 

Why STRP Is Misunderstood: 
1. Microcap Spinoff: Many investors have not thoroughly analyzed STRP due to its recent spinoff status. 
2. Unconventional CEO: Investor discomfort with the CEO's background may deter deeper research into the company. 
3. Complex Intangible Assets: STRP's value is derived from spectrum assets and patents, which have not yet generated significant revenue. 
4. Poor Disclosure: Lack of understanding on how to value spectrum assets 
5. Risk/Reward Misperception: Some investors view STRP as a lottery ticket, not realizing its potential value even in a piecemeal sale scenario. 

Business Overview: 
STRP owns Straight Path Spectrum, which holds a significant portion of the nation's wireless spectrum in the 39 GHz frequency, and Straight Path IP Group, which owns patents related to communications over the Internet. 

Patents Overview: 
The IP Group aims to license its patents and has successfully settled patent infringement cases in the past. Top law firms are willing to litigate on a contingency basis, indicating the potential value of the patents. 

Spectrum Technology Overview: 
As mobile data usage grows, small cells are becoming more important in providing wireless coverage. STRP's spectrum assets in the 39 GHz frequency are well-positioned for small cell backhaul, making them valuable in the evolving mobile communication landscape. 

Spectrum Valuation: 
STRP's spectrum assets could be valuable in a national rollout scenario with a telecom operator. Even in a piecemeal sale, the spectrum could fetch significant value. 

Sum of the Parts Valuation: 
Combining the valuation of patents and spectrum assets, the total value of STRP is estimated to be between $52.7 million and $599 million. 

Risks: 
Potential risks include uncertainty around patents, small cell deployment, and management control. However, the downside risk is mitigated by the company's asset value. 

Conclusion: 
STRP presents a compelling risk/reward opportunity with potential upside in both patents and spectrum assets. The target price of $9.58 offers significant upside potential for investors."
