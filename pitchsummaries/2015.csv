Parkit__SIR.pdf,"Parkit Enterprises Inc. is a real estate investor focused on US parking lots. They formed a joint venture called OP Holdings in April 2015 with Och-Ziff and ProPark, with a goal to aggregate up to US$500 million in income-producing parking assets and optimize yield. They also own Nashville Airport Parking separately. Parkit provides parking services for hotels, airports, universities, and other establishments, using technology to optimize cash flow. 

Since their original pitch in March 2015, Parkit has sold Canopy and Expresso properties into the JV, resulting in a 22% equity interest in OP. Management changes in 2016 led to a new CEO and CFO. The stock has seen a 40% decrease since the original pitch. The company's cash flow from the JV is strong, but expenses have exceeded management fees, leading to negative net income.

A downside DCF analysis shows a negative total FCF for the company. However, recent updates indicate that Parkit is producing positive cash flow and net income without earn-outs. A Net Asset Valuation approach values Parkit's equity at $21.7 million CAD, with a fair share value of $0.67 CAD or $0.50 USD, representing an 85% upside from the current share price of $0.27 USD.

New management is expected to bring significant cost reductions in 2017. Risks include interest rate hikes and the potential impact of driverless cars on the parking industry. It is suggested to hold onto the investment until a 20% discount from fair value is reached, which would be around $0.40 USD per share. 

In conclusion, Parkit Enterprises Inc. shows potential for growth and improvement, with a current valuation suggesting it may be undervalued. Investors are advised to monitor the company's performance and consider holding or potentially increasing their investment."
