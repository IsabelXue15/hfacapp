James__Jewett-Cameron__SIR.pdf,"Jewett-Cameron (JCTCF) is a company that has an overlooked lawn segment that is experiencing consistent growth. The net asset value of the company accounts for nearly 50% of its total value. The management of the company is shareholder-friendly and has significant ownership. The conservative valuation of the lawn business and company assets leaves room for a 10-50% premium on the current stock price.

The current price of Jewett-Cameron stock is $9.69 with a target price of $12.50, offering a potential return of 29%. The company has an equity of $27.5 million, an enterprise value of $23.1 million, and an EV/EBITDA ratio of 5.75.

Jewett-Cameron's business model consists of wood and metal products, with the lawn and garden segment growing rapidly. They distribute their products online through platforms like Amazon and Wayfair, receiving favorable reviews. The company has subsidiaries and a distribution center in Oregon.

Revenue for the company comes from different segments, with the lawn segment showing operating income margins from 0% to 16% over the years. Jewett-Cameron faces competition in the market but has a strong position due to its overlooked lawn segment and shareholder-friendly management.

The company has seen margin compressions and one-time revenue declines, leading to a selloff in their stock. However, the company has a strong management team and a conservative valuation, which could lead to a premium on the stock price in the future.

Overall, Jewett-Cameron presents an opportunity for investors due to its growth potential in the lawn segment, net asset value, and shareholder-friendly management."
Kevin__CTO__SIR.pdf,"Consolidated-Tomoka Land (CTO) is a real estate operator founded over 100 years ago with Florida land holdings on the books for historically low prices. The thesis is to sell the land using a like-kind exchange rule to defer income taxes on capital gains, then reinvest 100% of the net sales into income-producing properties. This tax-free monetization of undervalued hard assets by talented management offers an asymmetric risk-reward with near-term catalysts.

The company's financial overview includes a market cap of $270,159,201, with total assets valued at $974,177,000 in a bull scenario. The income statement shows revenue growth from $12,966,000 in 2011 to $25,838,000 in 2013, with net income growing from ($4,706,000) to $3,683,000 over the same period.

Key asset holdings include land portfolios in different areas, such as Parcel A, Parcel B, and Parcel C, with varying price per acre listings. The income properties have a net operating income of $12,264,000 and are diversified across quality tenants.

Management diligence highlights the CEO and CFO's extensive real estate experience and shareholder-friendly dynamics, including activist mutual fund Wintergreen Advisers' involvement. The risks and mitigants focus on rising interest rates, management execution, and unlocking value in a complex segmental structure.

Catalysts for growth include smart, lean, shareholder-aligned management, a 25% long-term stake held by a vocal activist, and potential REIT conversion. Growth drivers in Daytona Beach, where CTO's properties are located, include infrastructure developments and housing growth.

In conclusion, CTO's undervalued assets, potential tax-free monetization, and strong management make it an attractive investment opportunity with significant upside potential. Additional developments and pending rezoning requests indicate imminent catalysts for further growth."
Trent__USAK__SIR.pdf,"USA Truck (NASDAQ: USAK) is a company with two business segments: Trucking and Logistics/Strategic Capacity Solutions. The Trucking segment faced challenges from 2005-2013, while the SCS segment has performed well but its growth has been overshadowed by the Trucking segment. The company specializes in medium to long-haul freight and is the 29th largest trucking company in the nation. USA Truck has historically had poor management but has shown signs of improvement since 2013.

The business model for the Trucking segment involves providing cost-effective transportation solutions through a freight brokerage business. The company leverages its large existing client base and has brand power with 96% of its top 100 customers using multiple services through USAK. The SCS/Logistics segment has shown potential for success through cost-cutting initiatives, with the possibility of the Trucking segment being sold if it does not succeed.

USA Truck has made progress in its turnaround efforts, focusing on reducing costs and improving efficiencies. The company has seen success in areas such as fuel efficiency and insurance claims expense, but still struggles with high driver turnover. Activist hedge funds have shown interest in the company, with Stone House Capital and Baker Street Capital having ties to prominent investors.

The valuation of USA Truck is considered to be undervalued, with potential catalysts such as a sale of the Trucking segment or improvements in its turnaround efforts. The company's industry is seen as unglamorous with low barriers to entry, but its historical mismanagement and ongoing turnaround efforts have deterred some investors. There are risks involved, such as the potential failure of the turnaround, high driver turnover, and increased costs like fuel expenses."
