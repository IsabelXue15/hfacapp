Pitch,Summary
Coupang_Cassie.pdf,"Coupang (CPNG) is the largest eCommerce company in South Korea, with a Total Addressable Market (TAM) of $550B. Founded in 2010, Coupang offers various product commerce options, including owned inventory, third-party merchants, grocery delivery, subscription services, and advertising. The company has a strong competitive advantage due to its end-to-end logistics network and high market share in 1P inventory. Coupang's CEO, Bom Suk Kim, follows a customer-oriented capital allocation strategy similar to Amazon's, focusing on long-term growth segments.

The analysts recommend a long position on Coupang due to three key factors: Taiwan expansion, high-margin businesses, and the recent acquisition of Farfetch. The Taiwan expansion is expected to mirror the success of the South Korean market, with high population density and a favorable competitive landscape. Coupang's high-margin businesses, including advertising and fintech services, are projected to drive significant revenue growth. The Farfetch acquisition, completed at a bargain price of $500 million, is seen as a strategic move to enhance Coupang's luxury goods offerings and increase spend per active member.

Despite some risks, such as competition from Chinese eCommerce platforms and execution challenges in Taiwan, the analysts believe that Coupang's strong market position and strategic initiatives make it an attractive investment opportunity. The company's potential for international growth, particularly in Taiwan, combined with its focus on high-margin businesses, positions it for long-term success. The analysts recommend monitoring upcoming events, such as regulatory changes and the accretive impact of the Farfetch acquisition, to gauge Coupang's future performance."
Fleetcor_Isabel.pdf,"Fleetcor (FLT) is a business payments and spend management company that offers various cards and programs to help companies monitor costs.

Fleetcor operates multiple business segments, including fuel cards, tolls, parking, AP automation, virtual cards, corporate payments, lodging, and more.

The company's historical multiples have been low compared to historicals, but EPS has compounded over time.

The investment thesis for Fleetcor includes cross-selling opportunities between different business segments, especially between vehicle solutions and corporate payments. The company is also targeting small and mid-sized fleets through new product offerings and is well-prepared for the transition to electric vehicles. Fleetcor plans to accelerate cross-selling to drive corporate payments to become a larger share of revenue.

Overall, Fleetcor has strong potential for growth through cross-selling, targeting SMBs, and capitalizing on the growing EV market. However, there are risks surrounding management, pricing power, and market share contraction.

Grab_Tyler.pdf,"Grab is a super-app that combines ride-hailing, food delivery, and financial services into one platform. It operates in 500+ cities across 8 countries and has over 37.7 million Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) and over 5 million merchant partners. Grab leverages unique flywheel and network effects in mobility, delivery, financials, and advertisements. In 2018, Uber sold its Southeast Asian business to Grab in exchange for a 27.5% stake in the company. Grab merged with a SPAC in 2021 as the largest Southeast Asian company on the US market.

Grab's revenue segmentation includes ride-hailing, delivery, financial wallet and payment system (GrabPay), enterprise and new initiatives, and GrabAds. Grab is a clear market leader in the ride-hailing space and is well-positioned for market growth and competition. The company monopolizes the ride-hailing market in all the countries it operates in, except for Indonesia where it shares a duopoly with Gojek. Grab is also a major player in all national markets and is the market leader in Singapore for financial services.

The company's GrabAds segment, which comprises around 75% of its Enterprise and New Initiatives, is often overlooked but is a significant driver of profitability. Grab aggressively discounts its top-line, leading to undervaluation on a Price/Sales basis. Grab Ads has the potential to drive top-line growth and margins, with estimates that it will make up 2.75% of Delivery GMV by 2028. Grab's unique accounting practices and the treatment of incentives contribute to its undervaluation compared to its competitors.

Grab faces regulatory risks, competition from Gojek, and macroeconomic risks. However, the company's strong network effects, moat, and government support in other markets help mitigate these risks. Overall, Grab's competitive advantages, strong market presence, and potential growth in its ad business make it an attractive investment opportunity despite the risks."

Founded in 2017, the company markets itself as a modern personalized health and wellness SaaS company targeting Millennials and Gen Z consumers. Hims initially specialized in men's health products before expanding to women's health, mental health, and dermatology. The CEO aims to position HIMS as the primary platform for non-emergency medical care in the US.

The company's business model revolves around increasing subscribers, reducing marketing expenses by encouraging word-of-mouth referrals and longer customer retention, and increasing monthly online average revenue per user. Hims operates in the rapidly growing telehealth industry, which has seen an influx of new competitors including big tech companies like Amazon. The DTC industry has faced challenges such as increasing marketing expenses and reevaluation of valuations post-2021.

The analysis highlights concerns about Hims' competitive moat, customer retention rates, and personalized medication strategy. The company's ability to justify its premium prices, retain customers long-term, and navigate regulatory risks are questioned. Issues such as declining monthly average revenue per subscriber, increasing customer acquisition costs, and risks associated with cross-selling compounded medications are raised. The analysis also suggests that Hims may face challenges in differentiating itself from competitors and maintaining its market share.

The valuation analysis recommends a lower exit multiple of 1.2x TEV/Revenue compared to the current multiple of 3.3x, resulting in a projected share price of $8.60. The analysis factors in slower revenue growth, stagnant monthly online revenue per average subscriber, and escalating marketing expenses. It also takes into account the potential impact of regulatory risks and competition on Hims' financial performance."

Despite competition, Lululemon's strong sales productivity and focus on quality products have helped it maintain a competitive edge. The company has seen growth in international markets, particularly in China, and continues to focus on innovation and partnerships to drive growth.

The investment thesis for Lululemon includes global demand momentum, low brand awareness, and long-term innovation through initiatives like the Power of Three x 2. The company's strong product innovation pipeline, acquisitions like Mirror, and partnerships with Peloton contribute to its growth potential. However, risks include increasing competition, decelerating fundamentals, and a slowdown in the US market.

The shift to mobile gaming and virtual reality are potential risks, but Nintendo's ability to adapt and innovate mitigates these threats.

Overall, the recommendation for Nintendo is long, with the upcoming Switch 2 and strong lineup of games serving as key catalysts for growth. The company's unique position in the gaming industry and dedicated fan base make it a strong investment opportunity."

ON has three main segments: PSG, ASG, and ISG, each contributing to the company's revenue. 

The investment thesis for ON is based on the growing demand for SiC products from the EV and hybrid markets.

ON is well-positioned to capture this market growth, with a rapidly growing market share in SiC and vertical integration capabilities.

Papa Johns (PZZA) is a long recommendation with Cassie Liu as the SIR Director and analysts Dev Madhavani, James Rourke, and Maddie Stearns. The company, founded in 1984, operates pizza delivery and carryout restaurants with various business segments including domestic company-owned units, North America franchise units, North America commissary centers, and international units. The company has seen a 1.6% revenue growth in FY23 with an operating margin of 7.3%.

The investment thesis for Papa Johns includes a potential multiple re-rate from same-store sales growth, incentive-driven unit expansion, and the belief that competitive fears are overblown. The company's strategic changes include an advertising waiver for new units and case-volume rebates to drive unit growth. The analysts believe that Dominos' exclusive deal with UberEats will have minimal impact on Papa Johns' aggregator market share. The valuation model predicts a share price of $103.01 with a 25% IRR based on assumptions of franchise openings, order volume growth, and revenue mix shifts.

Risks for Papa Johns include execution failure from CEO changes, rising labor costs, and industry headwinds like GLP-1 drugs affecting food consumption.

Starbucks has three main business segments: company-operated stores, licensed stores, and channel development.

The Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) and coffee shop industry is competitive, but Starbucks maintains a strong position as a market leader. The industry is characterized by convenience, affordability, and speed, with Starbucks representing a significant portion of the U.S. coffee shop market.

UPST_Tyler.pdf,"Summary:
Upstart is a company that was founded in 2012, initially focusing on personal loans and developing an AI model to rate borrowers more accurately. However, the analysts believe that Upstart's AI value proposition is a lie, as they primarily function as a marketer to borrowers rather than leveraging AI technology effectively. They have underperformed in difficult macroeconomic environments and have questionable credit decisions. Upstart partners with three low-quality banks, which poses a perpetual risk to their business. The company's recent initiatives, such as the HELOC program, are seen as distractions and not likely to drive meaningful growth. The analysts project a conservative price target of $15, citing methodological discrepancies and unsustainable loan volumes. Despite the potential for a short squeeze and short-term macro risks, the team believes that Upstart should only be a small portion of an investment portfolio due to its risky nature."
