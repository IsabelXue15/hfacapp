BryanHarsha__Pattern__SIR.pdf,"Summary:

The 8th Annual STOCK conference focused on Pattern Energy Group (NASDAQ: PEGI) and recommended a SELL with a 2% IRR. The team from Harvard University, including Bryan Lee, Harsha Paladugu, and Sarah Hong, presented their investment thesis, highlighting traditional yieldco risks such as high leverage and reliance on external financing. Despite claims of liquidity and a robust wind farm pipeline, low dividend growth is forecasted due to insufficient low-cost liquidity. The financial overview of PEGI showed a share price of $19.66, a market cap of $1.93B, and an enterprise value of $4.78B.

PEGI operates renewable power projects primarily wind farms in the US, Canada, and Japan. It is a ""yieldco"" for Pattern Development, earning revenue from long-term power purchase agreements. The company has a geographically diverse portfolio and low counterparty concentration. The presentation also discussed the industry overview, industry risks, and PEGI's stock history.

The investment rationale highlighted issues with access to low-cost equity and debt financing, lack of liquidity for project pipeline growth, and improper management incentives. The team also presented a valuation using a Dividend Discount Model with a base case of 2% IRR, focusing on key drivers such as MW growth, interest rates, and debt.

Overall, the presentation raised concerns about PEGI's ability to meet its 5k MW target by 2020, leading to a recommendation to SELL the stock."

Emily__TPNL__SIR.pdf,"NASDAQ: TPNL is a provider of innovative prepaid card programs and processing services through its ""PaySign"" payment platform. The company's main focus is on providing prepaid debit cards for the plasma donation industry, accounting for almost 100% of its business. TPNL's prepaid cards have replaced cash payments in donation centers, providing a more secure and efficient method of payment. The company has been able to gain market share by capitalizing on the mistakes of its main competitor, Wirecard.

The plasma donation industry is essential for medical research, with donations expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.9% in the coming years. TPNL's main customers in the industry are CSL, Griffols, and Shire. TPNL has been expanding its market share by opening more donation centers and increasing the number of donations per center. The company also sees growth opportunities in other segments like pharmaceutical copay, general reloadable cards, corporate expenses, and healthcare reimbursement.

TPNL's inherent business model is considered excellent, with high returns on capital and a strong presence in a duopoly industry structure. The company's customers are sticky, signing long-term contracts, and are recession-resistant. TPNL is expected to continue growing in the plasma industry and potentially overtake its main competitor. The valuation of the company suggests strong growth potential, with a base case target price of $6.06 by 2022.

There are catalysts such as increased investor awareness, expansion into other business segments, and an up-listing to Nasdaq that could drive the company's stock price higher. However, risks include customer concentration and potential regulatory changes in the plasma industry. In summary, TPNL operates in a niche industry with significant opportunities for growth, but further research is required due to the limited available information on the company."

Jordan__Stein__SIR.pdf,"Executive Summary:
Stein Mart (SMRT) has seen a decline in stock value from 2015 to Q1 2018 due to poor earnings and competition from online shopping. The company almost filed for bankruptcy due to poor management of the balance sheet. However, new management has a strategic growth plan in place that the market has not fully considered. Improved supply chain and inventory management have led to increased margins and debt reduction. The company is transitioning into online retail, which is expected to benefit it.

Company Overview:
Stein Mart is a discount retail store focusing on seasonal, name brand apparel for men and women, as well as homeware and fashion accessories. Founded in 1902, the company operates 293 stores primarily in the Southeast and Texas. Recent changes in leadership and cost-cutting measures have improved the company's future cash flows. The new management has a focus on reducing debt and improving the balance sheet.

Industry Overview:
The retail industry is highly competitive, both in E-Commerce and in-store retail. Stein Mart faces competition from large retailers and the threat of losing customers to online giants like Amazon. However, the company's revenue has remained steady, indicating resilience. There are opportunities for expansion, particularly in capturing market share from declining department stores like Sears.

Comps:
Comparing SMRT to other retailers, it trades at a discount and has potential for growth. The company's gross margin and sales per square foot are favorable, indicating room for improvement. The stock price is low, making it undervalued.

Valuation:
Assuming 1% year-over-year growth initially, followed by 1.5% growth, with constant COGS and decreasing SG&A, the company's valuation looks promising. DCF analysis with a conservative WACC of 8% and a Gordon Growth Rate of 2% indicates potential for growth. ROIC analysis is also positive, suggesting a favorable outlook for the company."
Kiffen__RVI__SIR.pdf,"Retail Value Inc. (NYSE: RVI) is a retail Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that was spun off from DDR in July 2018 as part of a portfolio re-shuffling. The spin off included 37 continental US assets and all 12 of DDR's Puerto Rican assets at the time of the sale. RVI is focused on retail properties with major tenants such as Walmart, TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Bed Bath and Beyond. The company plans to liquidate properties over the next 24-36 months with DDR continuing to run RVI's operations through 2019.

As a REIT, RVI receives generous tax benefits by distributing 100% of earnings to shareholders, resulting in no tax payment. To qualify as a REIT, a company must earn at least 75% of revenues from real estate, have at least 75% of assets as real estate assets, earn 95% of income as passive income, and distribute 90% of taxable income annually to shareholders as dividends.

RVI's assets are concentrated on the east coast and midwest of the US, with two assets in Arizona. The company has already sold 7 US properties for a cumulative consideration of $187.2 million, with 30 properties still owned by RVI. In Puerto Rico, RVI owns 12 assets concentrated in San Juan, Isabela, Fajardo, and Guayama. While the PR economy has been recovering from a downturn, federal assistance programs have helped support the retail sector.

The investment thesis for RVI is that it currently trades at a 30% discount to Net Asset Value (NAV) with a quick path to value realization through asset sales within 2-3 years. The market misunderstands the PR assets, which have received minimal damage and have been supported by government assistance programs. Further diligence involves analyzing each property individually, understanding the impact of Sears bankruptcy and PetSmart restructuring on RVI, and timing asset sales and distributions to shareholders."

Opportunities for the company include expanding into international markets and rebranding Family Dollar stores, while threats include rising costs and trade policy shifts.

ZhangLeeHuang__HFAC_Quant_Pitch.pdf,"Summary of HFAC Quant Technical Analysis Project:

The HFAC Quant Technical Analysis Project, conducted by William Yuan, Bill Zhang, Alex Spiride, Jonathan Huang, Nathan Zhao, and Bryan Lee, focuses on the use of technical analysis in forecasting price directions through the examination of past market data, specifically price and volume. Technical analysis relies on charts and graphs to identify patterns for making investment decisions, with the belief that prices accurately reflect economic trends and publicly-available information before investors are aware of them. The project does not involve stock valuation but rather focuses on short-term trades.

Key assumptions of technical analysis include the idea that the market discounts everything, price moves in trends, and history tends to repeat itself. Various technical indicators such as relative strength index, MACD, Williams % R, momentum, time series forecasting, among others, are used to analyze market data.

The project also introduces Quantopian, an online platform for algorithmic trading that provides access to free data sets for analyzing stocks. Users can research stocks using historical price, fundamental, and technical data, develop trading algorithms, and backtest their strategies. The Quantopian API offers historical data for US markets and includes built-in fundamental and technical factors for analysis.

In constructing a pipeline for algorithmic trading on Quantopian, users must select a universe of stocks to analyze, import or create factors for scoring stocks, calculate portfolio allocations, and backtest to evaluate the historical performance of factors.

The project also discusses the challenges of backtesting, highlighting the potential biases that can arise from trading affecting prices, survivor-biased data, and the lack of supply and demand dynamics in instantaneous backtest trades.

Single factor analysis is used to identify factors predictive of relative price movements for a long-short equity strategy. Sample factors discussed include the Williams % R, Accumulation Distribution Line, Ultimate Oscillator, and a Hybrid Factor incorporating factors like EV/EBITDA, Relative Strength Index, and Volume Weighted Average Price.

Future projects for the HFAC Quant team include pairs trading with cointegration, technical indicator feature selection with Random Forests, and Bayesian Regularized Artificial Neural Network modeling based on previous research studies."
