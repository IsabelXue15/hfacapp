Pitch,Summary
GrantWonders__HOT.pdf,"Starwood Hotels (NYSE: HOT) is a struggling medium and high-end hotel chain that is franchise-driven, with thousands of hotels worldwide but only 6 billion in property, plant, and equipment. The company has a market capitalization of 6 billion and has conducted a massive share buyback over the past few years. 

Key metrics for Starwood Hotels include a PE ratio of 27.19, a fiscal 2009 revenue growth of -21.5%, a past 5-year growth rate of -7.4%, and a projected 5-year growth rate of 1.83%. The PEG ratio is 23.03. In 2009, the company earned $130 million, and in 2010, earnings dropped to $111 million. 

On the balance sheet, Starwood Hotels has 6,070 billion in property, plant, and equipment, 1,639 billion in net goodwill, total assets of 9,703 billion, total liabilities of 8,082 billion, and total equity of 1,621 billion. The company has total debt of 4.08 billion, with 1.5 billion due in the next year. The average interest rate is 5.24%, and there is still 1.585 billion available on the revolver. 

The credit situation for Starwood Hotels is a concern, with S&P rating it BB+ with a negative outlook and Moody's recently downgrading it to Ba1. If the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt, it may be required to sell assets at lower amounts or refinance debt at unfavorable rates. 

The recommendation for Starwood Hotels is a short position, with a discounted cash flow analysis pointing to a price target of 14.07 based on EBITDA multiples and growth assumptions. This analysis takes into account a 10% growth rate starting in 2011, interest expenses at 3%, and a discount rate of 9% based on a beta of 1.94. 

Overall, the financial situation and credit outlook for Starwood Hotels suggest challenges ahead, making it a risky investment option."

GrantWonders__Wyeth.pdf,"Summary:
Amol Jain, John Zhao, and Grant Wonders discussed the PFE-WYE Arbitrage, focusing on Pfizer and Wyeth. Pfizer is facing challenges with its Lipitor patent expiration, leading to a potential $13 billion loss in revenue per year. Wyeth, on the other hand, has a balanced pipeline with new drugs in development. The factors of the deal include governmental interventions, potential layoffs, and a credit rating downgrade for Pfizer. Financial analysis shows that the deal is valued at $60 billion, with expected closing date on 10-31-2009. The profit strategy discussed involved selling Pfizer and buying Wyeth shares. Closing thoughts expressed doubts about the merger creating value for Pfizer's shareholders, with concerns about the company's future due to lack of pipeline and potential acquisition strategy."
