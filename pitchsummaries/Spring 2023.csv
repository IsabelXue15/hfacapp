Pitch,Summary
Cathy___AMD___SIR.pdf,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is a leading CPU and GPU manufacturer with a strong global presence. The company competes with Intel in the CPU market and NVIDIA in the GPU market. AMD has a technological edge in data centers and generative AI growth, which is expected to drive data center growth. The company's current valuation is attractive, making it a long recommendation.

Key financials of AMD (as of 3/2/23) include a market cap of $126.2B, enterprise value of $123.3B, LTM revenue of $23.6B, and LTM EBIT of $1.46B. The semiconductor industry is projected to decrease in FY23 but is expected to see growth in FY24 and beyond.

AMD's data center segment has seen significant revenue growth, with revenue increasing from $1.6bn in FY21 to $6bn in FY22. The company's EPYC offering outperforms Intel's Xeon, giving AMD a competitive advantage in AI applications. AMD's market position in AI is supported by acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando.

The company also has proprietary CPU innovations and a strong presence in the GPU market, supplying GPUs for major gaming consoles and Tesla cars. AMD's technological advantages, such as Infinity Fabric and Ryzen CPUs, contribute to its market position.

Risks for AMD include supply chain disruptions, regulatory risks, materials cost, and inflation affecting consumer spending. However, the company has mitigants in place to address these risks.

AMD's competitive landscape includes Intel and other CPU and GPU makers. Price-to-earnings multiple analysis shows a promising entry point for investors. The bull case implies an upside of 92.6%, with a target price of $155, while the bear case suggests a 7.9% upside with a target price of $86.80.

Overall, AMD's strong technological edge in data centers and generative AI growth, coupled with its attractive valuation, make it a compelling long-term investment opportunity with significant upside potential."
Cathy___Micron___SIR.pdf,"Semiconductors are a critical aspect of the electronics industry, with major players like Intel, Samsung, TSMC, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Texas Instruments leading the market. The industry is projected to reach $726.73 billion by 2027 and is driven by growth in sectors like smart devices (IoT, AI, 5G, autonomous vehicles), renewables (solar power, wind turbines), and electric vehicles.

Micron Technology, Inc. is a key player in the semiconductor industry, specializing in memory and storage products. With segments like Compute and Networking Business Unit, Mobile Business Unit, Embedded Business Unit, and Storage Business Unit, Micron offers a wide range of memory products for various markets. However, analysts suggest that the semiconductor industry, including Micron, is currently experiencing excess inventory and is entering a lower profit part of the supply cycle.

The US-China tensions have impacted the semiconductor industry, with China investing heavily in its domestic semiconductor industry to reduce reliance on US suppliers. Recently, China launched a cybersecurity probe into Micron, seen as retaliation for US restrictions on technology sales to Beijing.

Despite market pessimism and concerns about supply-glut downturns, Micron's strategic moves indicate a long-term de-risking strategy rather than random geopolitical risks. It is suggested to watch for an entry point within the next year and not obsess over timing the market perfectly. The China risk is seen as a strategic turn away from the segment rather than a classic geopolitical risk, benefiting Micron's competitors in the short term."

C3.ai is a software company founded in 2009 by Thomas Siebel, offering enterprise solutions powered by AI. They provide an AI development platform for creating and implementing enterprise applications, as well as a portfolio of pre-built AI applications. The company went public in December 2020 with a valuation of $9.6 billion. Their revenue model includes a core product, AI applications, a no-code ML data science platform, an AI-enhanced CRM, and an advanced data visualizer.

The competitive landscape for C3.ai is intense, with established players like Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft leading the way in CRM innovation. The market for enterprise AI is large and growing, with a forecasted CAGR of 12.1% over the next 7 years. However, C3.ai faces specific challenges such as unclear TAM estimates and a minuscule market share.

Recent changes in C3.ai's revenue model from subscription-based to consumption-based pricing have raised concerns among analysts. The switch may slow revenue growth in both the short and long term, with a decrease in average contract value and potential customer churn.

The company has also faced challenges related to customer counting, with reports of inflated customer numbers and potential accounting manipulations. Major stakeholders, such as partner Baker Hughes, have shown dwindling confidence in C3.ai, which could impact the company's revenue.

Analysts recommend a short position on C3.ai due to concerns about the new revenue model, customer counting issues, and uncertainties surrounding major partnerships. They also highlight risks related to the company's financials, market competition, and management turnover. Overall, the outlook for C3.ai is mixed, with potential for growth but significant challenges to overcome."

1. Underappreciated Pricing Power of Monopoly: The market underestimates PRM's pricing power despite its monopoly in the fire retardant market.
