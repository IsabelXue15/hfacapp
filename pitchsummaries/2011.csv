Trent__USAK__SIR.pdf,"Summary:

USA Truck (NASDAQ: USAK) is a transportation company with two main business segments: trucking and logistics/strategic capacity solutions (SCS). The trucking segment struggled from 2005 to 2013, while the SCS segment performed well but its growth was overshadowed by the trucking segment. The company specializes in medium to long-haul freight and is the 29th largest trucking company in the nation, operating in a highly fragmented industry.

The company has historically had poor management but saw improvement after 2013. USA Truck operates a freight brokerage business that provides cost-effective transportation solutions, leveraging its large existing client base. The SCS/logistics business has shown potential for success through cost-cutting measures, although progress has been slower than expected.

The company has made efforts to turn around its trucking business by expanding and then reducing its fleet size, shortening haul lengths, and hiring a new CEO in 2013. Progress has been seen in revenue growth and cost initiatives, but challenges remain, such as high driver turnover.

Activist hedge funds have shown interest in USA Truck, with potential catalysts being the valuation of the SCS business at a discounted multiple compared to peers, and the possibility of a sale or improved performance in the trucking segment. The company is considered undervalued due to its historical mismanagement, lengthy turnaround process, and potential risks such as high driver turnover and increased costs.

Overall, there is potential for USA Truck to improve its performance and unlock value for shareholders, making it a recommended buy according to HFAC IR. 

Financial Snapshot:
- Market Cap: $192 million
- Adjusted EV/EBITDA (ttm): 5.87
- Adjusted FCF yield: 11.5%"
Chodan__WDC__SIR.pdf,"Stock: Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ: WDC)
Current Price: $64.15 (10/3/13 Closing)
Target Price: $86.58
Recommendation: Buy

Thesis:
We believe that WDC is undervalued due to its association with the declining PC market, which overlooks its ability to adapt to changing hard drive demands. With a leading market share in PC hard drives, WDC is poised for growth in non-PC markets driven by increasing data storage demand. The company has excess factory capacity, enabling it to maintain or increase margins as demand grows.

Company Background:
WDC is a leading developer and manufacturer of storage solutions under brands like HGST, WD, and G-Technology. Its principal product is hard drives using rotating magnetic disks, holding a 45% market share of hard drive shipments.

Industry/Key Developments:
The storage industry is cyclical, with hard drives being the primary storage medium. Revenue from PC HDDs is expected to decline, while growth will come from the enterprise HDD market and cloud-based storage.

Explanation of Thesis:
WDC's value lies in its ability to shift revenue from the shrinking PC market to more lucrative enterprise segments. The company's margins should increase as the enterprise segment grows stronger.

Valuation:
Key valuation assumptions are based on projected industry unit shipments by segment through 2017. Comparables include INTCSNDSKSTX with various valuation metrics.

Key Risks:
Challenges include a highly competitive industry, a concentrated customer base, and the uncertainty of acquisitions paying off if storage methods are not updated.

Potential Catalysts:
WDC's shift to the enterprise market, development of helium-filled hard drive platforms, and a favorable ruling from the Chinese ministry could increase efficiency and share value.

Thesis Summary:
WDC's market leadership and potential growth in non-PC markets make it undervalued. As the company focuses on the enterprise segment, margins are expected to increase. With strong demand for data storage, WDC's value is likely to be recognized."
Connor__INFU__SIR.pdf,"InfuSystem (INFU) is a company founded in 2005 and based in Michigan. They provide infusion pumps and services to oncology clinics in the U.S. and Canada for various cancer treatments, including colorectal cancer. They receive payment through insurance companies or patients directly. Despite experiencing strong revenue growth in recent years, incompetent management caused losses. Activist investors, including Ryan Morris of Meson Capital Partners, worked to improve the company's performance by cutting costs and improving efficiency.

The company faced risks such as potential Medicare reimbursement cuts and competition from generic drugs like Xeloda. However, with the help of activist investors, InfuSystem implemented cost-cutting measures and improved the management of its subsidiary, First Biomed. Valuation methodologies suggested that the company was undervalued, with the market not factoring in recent improvements.

Overall, InfuSystem presents a special situation opportunity for investors, with the potential for significant upside if the company continues on its current path of improvement. The market is not fully reflecting the company's potential, making it undervalued by up to 174%."
Connor__NobleRomans__SIR.pdf,"Summary:
- Noble Roman's, ticker symbol NROM, is currently trading at a price per share of $.73 with a market cap of $14.5 million. 
- The company, headquartered in Indiana, USA, began in 1972 as a small pizza operator and later transitioned into a franchising and supply chain pizza business.
- In 2008, the company was sued by former franchise owners for fraud, but in 2010, a court ruled in favor of Noble Roman's. The company is now countersuing for damages and legal expenses.
- The stock is currently undervalued, with a conservative discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation of $1.13 per share, representing a 46% upside potential.
- The best-case scenario projects a price per share of $1.67, while the worst-case scenario is $.72.
- Major catalysts for growth include potential legal payments, expansion in the take-and-bake market, and improvements in capital structure.
- Risks include potential legal liabilities, management missteps, and overly optimistic growth projections for grocery stores.

In conclusion, Noble Roman's presents an opportunity to buy a good business at a great price, with potential upside driven by legal payments, expansion in the take-and-bake market, and improvements in capital structure. The conservative estimated upside is 46%, with a target price of $1.13 per share."
NA___ORIG__SIR.pdf,"Ocean Rig (ORIG) is a stock with a recommendation to buy and a price target of $24, currently trading at $16 with a market cap of $2.16 billion and an enterprise value of $4.77 billion. The stock is undervalued due to market misunderstandings about its earnings power, management trust issues, and a dominant parent company as a forced seller. However, as profitability becomes apparent and management returns cash to shareholders, the stock is expected to be rerated.

The industry overview of ultra-deepwater drilling, operating at ocean depths of 5000+ feet, involves two types of rigs: semi-submersible platforms and drillships. Currently, there are 50 semi-submersibles and 62 drillships, with 80 more ships on the way. Companies like Ocean Rig buy drillships and charter them to oil companies, with compensation measured in day rates directly tied to a company's revenue.

Current market conditions are very favorable for rig owners with high day rates, insufficient supply to meet demand, and long-term contracts. The industry is at an advantage due to limited supply and strong demand, with oil prices being a significant driver. Ocean Rig is positioned well within the industry, undervalued on an asset basis, and has a substantial operating advantage.

A comps analysis shows that Ocean Rig looks undervalued on an asset basis but overvalued on an EBITDA basis for the trailing twelve months. A DCF analysis, based on key assumptions and sensitivity analysis, suggests that the stock is undervalued with significant upside potential.

Management risk is perceived due to George Economou's reputation, who founded Dryships and expanded Ocean Rig. However, despite his past actions, the management risk is considered overblown, and the company is running well so far with strong incentives for improvement.

In conclusion, Ocean Rig is a solidly undervalued company in a promising industry, and management risk is seen as manageable. With a potential rerating and catalysts like dividend institution or MLP setup, the stock is expected to have significant upside potential, with a target price of $24."
NA__AUXO__SIR.pdf,"Summary:

Ticker: AUXO
Recommendation: Buy
Current Price: $1.00
Target Price: $1.50

AUXO is a company with negative tangible book value, declining margins, a $20 million market cap, 0 years of profitability, a working capital shortage, and a history of dilutive financing. The market sees no profitability, a risky and unproven business model, pathetic gross margins, and no downside protection.

Auxilio is a provider of vendor-neutral, managed print services to hospitals. It signs hospitals on long-term contracts with guaranteed cost savings and targets 20-25% gross margins after a year. The business model has pros such as being sticky, specialized, and differentiated, but also cons such as high set-up costs and difficulty in convincing hospitals to switch providers.

AUXO has experienced massive growth in sales momentum but faces challenges due to expansion costs concealing profitable legacy business. Valuing AUXO is tough due to lumpy new contracts and one-time costs affecting operating results.

The no growth case valuation for 2014 reflects steady-state financials with an implied valuation of $19.42 million. The base case for 2017 shows potential net income of $5.6 million. The bull case envisions substantial growth in hospitals and EBITDA.

Risks for AUXO include declining print volumes, loss of customers, and inability to hit savings targets. Catalysts for the company include recent contract wins with major Catholic hospital chains, profitability in 2013, and potential uplisting.

In conclusion, AUXO presents a complex investment opportunity with potential upside if it can overcome its current challenges and capitalize on its growth opportunities."
NA__CWGL__SIR.pdf,"Summary of Crimson Wine (CWGL):

Crimson Wine Group (CWGL) is a boutique, estate-based winery company founded in 1991 that operates in California, Oregon, and Washington. They own interests in approximately 1,166 acres of vineyard and have 7 brands. They sell wine through online direct sales and distributors, with wine clubs accounting for 50% of direct sales. Crimson Wine Group is well-established across various wine markets and has top-quality wineries, including Seghesio Family Vineyards. 

The company has potential for sales and wine production expansion. In terms of competition, the industry is extremely competitive with 1,000 bonded wineries in California, but Crimson Wine Group has less than 1% market share. 

CWGL was spun off from Leucadia (LUK) as a dividend to existing LUK shareholders. The company owns substantial stakes in CWGL, and insiders have a high level of ownership. The company owns vineyards in California, with estimated total property value ranging from $192.2 million to $265 million. 

Comparing CWGL to peer companies, if CWGL were to trade at the peer group's average, the stock would be worth around $15, representing a 56% upside. If CWGL were to trade at the peer group's EV/EBIT multiple, the stock would be worth approximately $12.44, a 29% upside. 

The spinoff opportunity was created due to complex merger dynamics, leading to little institutional interest in CWGL. However, billionaire insiders hold large stakes in the company and are on the board. The company is expected to trade up to peer group levels in 2013, with a potential target price of $12.50-$15.00."
NA__STRP__SIR.pdf,"Summary:
Straight Path Communications Inc. (STRP) is a highly misunderstood security with a fantastic risk/reward opportunity, currently valued at a market cap of $61 million and an enterprise value of $46 million. The current price is $5.38 with a target price of $9.58, offering a potential 78% upside. 

STRP is a recent microcap spinoff from IDT Corporation, with two main assets: a portfolio of patents related to communications over the internet and a substantial portion of the nation's wireless spectrum in the 39 GHz frequency. The company's CEO, Davidi Jonas, is often a point of concern for investors due to his unconventional background. 

The patent portfolio has already shown success in settling patent infringement cases with companies like eBay and Skype. Legal powerhouses like Kirkland & Ellis are involved in patent litigation on a contingency basis, indicating the potential value of the patents. The estimated value of the patents ranges from $12.7 million to $88.7 million, providing significant downside protection for the stock.

The spectrum business of STRP is positioned to benefit from the growing demand for small cells in mobile communication. STRP holds licenses for 39 GHz frequencies, which are crucial for wireless backhaul in small cell networks. The potential revenue from the spectrum could range from $8.4 million to $46 million in 2016, resulting in a NPV of $43 million to $250 million.

Overall, a sum-of-the-parts valuation suggests that STRP's total value could range from $52.7 million to $599 million, with a value per share of $4.58 to $52.08. Risks include uncertainties around patent validity, small cell deployment, and the control structure of the Jonas family. However, the current price offers a compelling risk/reward opportunity for investors."
Connor__REGIS__SIR.pdf,"Summary:
1. Regis Corporation (RGS) is a recession-resistant business with a market cap of $974.51 M, currently trading at $17.71 per share. The company owns, operates, and franchises hairstyling and hair care salons in the US and internationally, with a stake in European salon schools and hair restoration businesses.
2. Despite operational improvements on the way, Regis is trading at less than 6x EV/EBITDA with a 1.50% dividend yield, making it cheap relative to its current earnings power.
3. Bad management practices have been masking the earnings power of Regis, with significant concerns raised by independent analysts and shareholders about management problems and related party transactions.
4. Starboard Value, an activist firm, has successfully engaged with Regis by obtaining three positions on the board and vowing to sell off non-core operations, reduce expenses by $70 million per year, and restore fiduciary duty. This activism is expected to unlock normal earnings power for Regis.
5. Taking into account the potential cost savings unlocked by Starboard, Regis is seen as a ""slam dunk"" investment opportunity, with the potential for significant upside based on the company's undervalued position and the operational improvements expected from the activist involvement.

In conclusion, Regis presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its recession-resistant nature, undervaluation relative to its earnings power, and the catalyst provided by Starboard Value to unlock normal earnings power through cost savings and operational improvements."

Ian__Teva__SIR.pdf,"Daniel Norton and Ian Townsend presented a detailed analysis of Teva, an Israeli pharmaceutical company with a focus on generic and branded healthcare products. They discussed Teva's three major divisions in the pharma industry, including generic drugs, proprietary drugs like Copaxone for multiple sclerosis, and active pharmaceutical ingredients. They highlighted the breakdown of Teva's revenue in 2011 and key products like Copaxone, Provigil, Nuvigil, and Plan B One-Step.

The presenters also talked about Israel's potential for investors, citing the strong banking sector, government surplus, and high R&D to GDP ratio. They discussed positive trends in the generic drug industry, Teva's M&A activity, and acquisitions made by the company in 2011. They noted that 2012 is seen as a good year to buy Teva due to widespread loss of patent protection for many popular drugs, which could lead to increased revenues for Teva.

The presentation included revenue projections for Teva's brand and generic drugs for 2012, based on historical sales data and assumptions about patent expiration and generic drug approvals. They recommended buying Teva as a long-term investment, with potential price appreciation from new generic products in 2012 and beyond. They provided conservative, moderate, and generous price targets for Teva stock, along with an average analyst target."
Jared__AxiaNetMedia__SIR.pdf,"Axia Netmedia, Inc. is a company operating in the Next Generation Network Solution sector. They own and operate networks, earning fees on the bandwidth used. The company has deployments in Alberta, France, Western Massachusetts, Spain, and Singapore, with $2 billion invested so far and 30,000 km of fiber. They have seen a 48% bandwidth usage growth year over year.

Opportunities for growth are seen in Europe and Singapore. The company's valuation is favorable with a P/B ratio of less than 1 and a 2-3% premium to net tangible assets. The NPV of current revenue shows a potential EBITDA of roughly $31 million, trading at around 3X EBITDA with a similar EV/EBITDA.

Despite being undervalued with strong downside potential, Axia's low trading volume, little investor interest, and doubts about future expansion potential have kept its stock price suppressed. However, as the company becomes more profitable and investor awareness increases, there is potential for significant appreciation in its stock price. The recommendation is to buy AXX.TO as a long-term hold with a target price of $2.50, more than 60% above current levels. Reevaluation is suggested for future profit potential."

JaredConnor__Reading__SIR.pdf,"Reading International (RDI) is undervalued in the market as it is primarily seen as a cinema operator, but its true value lies in its underappreciated real estate holdings. With a stock price of $4.63 (86% of book value), investors have significant downside protection and potential for over 100% upside.

The company operates 57 cinemas, 471 screens, and four live theaters with stable operating income of around $20 million per year. In terms of real estate, RDI owns retail developments anchored around modern multiplexes, prime real estate occupied by legacy theaters, and undeveloped land. Less than 10% of its owned real estate is currently developed.

Compared to other cinema operators in the market, RDI has a lower market cap and EV/EBITDA ratio, making it an attractive investment opportunity. The company's real estate portfolio includes motels, legacy theaters in prime locations, retail developments, and undeveloped land, totaling 16.5 million sq. ft. with only 1.2 million sq. ft. developed.

One valuation methodology suggests that if RDI were to sell off its entire real estate portfolio to eliminate debt, it would result in significant equity value per share with a 157% upside potential. Catalysts for the company's growth include the sale or development of its real estate assets, such as the anticipated sale of certain cinemas and potential land sales.

While risks include competition from substitutes like Netflix, exchange rate fluctuations, and ownership structure concerns, RDI presents an attractive investment opportunity due to its small market cap, unique business model, diverse real estate portfolio, and hidden asset value. Investors can potentially get $185 million in real estate value for free by investing in RDI, which is currently trading below its book value with minimal downside risk and significant upside potential."

Founded in the late 1990s, they purchase land from the Chinese government to develop high-rise housing projects. Despite being undervalued in the market at a current price of $2.82, XIN has a target price of $4.20.

With a market cap of $208 million, XIN has a net income of $103 million and a cash reserve of $487 million. The company's property under development is valued at $761.9 million. However, there are concerns about fraud and the Chinese housing bubble affecting XIN's valuation.

Despite these concerns, XIN is considered not to be a fraud due to its IPO process, the reputable auditor Ernst & Young, and the CFO's background. The company has also been transparent about its financial performance and engages in shareholder-friendly practices. In terms of the housing bubble, XIN has limited exposure to high-risk areas and is prepared to capitalize on lower land prices.

Overall, XIN's net cash is almost equal to its market cap, which limits downside potential. The stock seems to be pricing in losses that may not occur on the assumed scale. With $950 million in net tangible assets and strong earnings potential, XIN could be worth significantly more than its current share price suggests."

NA__InternetPatents__SIR.pdf,"Internet Patents Corporation (PTNT) â€“ Sell Pitch 2/19/2012

The recommendation to sell PTNT is based on several factors:

1. Currently sitting on a small approximately 1% gain.
2. The original thesis has changed and the stock is now fairly valued.
   - The asset sale of Bankrate.com (essentially their entire operations) was expected to lead to a larger than cash balance. While the sale did go through and the stock price did rise initially, the company incurred larger than expected taxes in the transaction, reducing the margin of error for investors.
   - After employee options are exercised, diluting current shareholders, the company will be slightly below cash running a patent-licensing business that will likely burn cash for at least 12 months.
3. Locking in a small gain over a short time period and allocating the funds elsewhere is recommended. There are too many good ideas in the market to keep cash in PTNT.

In summary, the sell pitch for Internet Patents Corporation (PTNT) on 2/19/2012 is based on the changing thesis, the company's financial position post-asset sale, and the need to reallocate funds to potentially more promising opportunities in the market."
NA__LYB__SIR.pdf,"Summary of LyondellBasell (LYB) Sell Pitch:

On 10/17/2011, 55 shares of LyondellBasell were purchased at $29.0097 per share. The investment thesis was based on LYB being undervalued relative to its peers (trading at 6x) and potentially being a takeover target due to its low debt. After conducting a DCF and comparable analysis, the price target was set at $36.

Currently, LYB is trading at $44.71 per share, exceeding the target price. There are no indications of a takeover by another company. LYB no longer trades at a discount relative to its peers, now trading at roughly 8.5x. The stock is trading near its 52-week high of $45.12 per share."

The group is considering investing in Sandstorm Gold Ltd., a company with a market cap of 149.07M that trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They are considering buying the Pink Sheets for an American Exchange. Sandstorm provides investment capital to late-stage mining and gas development companies in exchange for minimum future payments and deep in the money call options.

They operate on a streaming model and commodity purchase agreements, providing advantages for Sandstorm and the mining companies they work with.

Sandstorm has entered into a Copper Stream agreement with Donner Metals Ltd for $20M, with an option to purchase 17.5% of all copper for the life of the mine at the Bracemac-McLeod Property for $0.80/lb. The company uses conservative production values to determine IRR for their investments, generating IRRs of 23% for 2P, 5 years; 35% for M&I, 10 years; and 46% for Inferred, 15 years.

The CEO of Sandstorm, Nolan Watson, has a strong track record in the industry and has raised over $240 million for the company.

They used historical data to project commodity prices and considered the standard deviation in their analysis. Ultimately, they found Sandstorm to have an extremely attractive price with minimal risk of capital loss and significant upside potential."

Connor__Aeropostale__SIR.pdf,"Summary of (NYSE: ARO) Recommendation: Buy (PT: $35.00 +30%)

Aeropostale (ARO) is a specialty retailer currently trading at historical multiple lows. The company has shown consistent financial performance, with positive comp same-store sales despite challenging retail conditions. The stock is currently down 20% since May, providing a significant margin of safety. 

Key catalysts for investment include retail buyouts in play, significant share buybacks by company management, and the belief that shares are greatly undervalued. ARO has a high return on capital (ROC) and high earnings yield, with no debt. 

The company has shown strong performance metrics, with impressive gross margin, EBITDA margin, and net income margin. ARO's sales per square foot are among the highest in the industry. The company has been consistently buying back shares and accumulating cash on its balance sheet.

Relative valuation analysis shows ARO trading at a discount compared to its peers. Recent retail buyouts in the market suggest ARO could be a potential buyout candidate due to its management, high operating margin, high free cash flow yield, and undervaluation.

Overall, the investment thesis suggests that ARO is a solid buy opportunity with a price target of $35.00, representing a potential 30% increase. The company's strong financial performance and strategic initiatives make it an attractive investment choice."
Connor__BETM__SIR.pdf,"Special Ops focuses on special situations such as liquidations, post-bankruptcies, spin-offs, merger arbitrage, and value plays with a catalyst or hidden assets. Their role in HFAC is to find stocks that would otherwise go unnoticed because they ""screen poorly"" and provide event-driven investments that are uncorrelated with the rest of the portfolio. They dig deep in small and micro-caps for value, taking advantage of a relatively small capital base. Special Ops believes that hidden, event-driven, small-cap ideas are where HFAC can have the greatest advantage over other funds.

American Wagering (BETM) is a company that designs and markets equipment and software for sports and horse/dog racing. They were founded in 1995 and are headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. They offer an extensive network of betting kiosks and sportsbooks within bars, racetracks, and casinos, including MGM Grand and the Venetian. They also have a mobile application that allows bettors in Nevada to place wagers through their mobile phones or tablet devices.

BETM's revenue breakdown in Fiscal Year 2011 includes revenue from wagering, hotel/casino operations, and systems such as kiosk and sportsbook sales. On April 13th, 2011, William Hill signed a binding agreement to buy BETM for $18 million, translating to $0.90 per share after paying off its debt. The deal is pending approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission, with management expecting the merger to close in the first half of 2012. The current yield on the deal is 38%, with annualized best-case and worst-case scenarios of 139% and 47%, respectively.

William Hill, the acquirer, is one of the largest bookmakers in the UK with a market cap of $1.6 billion. They are looking to make three acquisitions in the US in 2012 and see significant growth opportunities in the American market. The deal with BETM is seen as a perfect opportunity to enter the American market and leverage existing relationships with casinos for kiosk and sportsbook operations.

The deal is expected to go through as it has been unanimously approved by BETM's board, and management owns more than 50% of the company's stock. The company has good assets but is too small to continue operations on its own. This opportunity exists because BETM is a micro-cap company trading OTC, which has kept it off the radar of most analysts and big investors.

Special Ops recommends initiating a position in BETM immediately with a limit price of $0.70."
Connor__InsWeb__SIR.pdf,"Summary:

- On October 10, 2011, InsWeb agreed to sell the majority of its business for $65 million in cash to Bankrate.
- InsWeb currently trades at $8.09 with an estimated fair value of $9.35, representing a 17% upside.
- InsWeb is an insurance lead company where insurers pay InsWeb whenever someone buys insurance through the lead.
- Bankrate is a larger insurance lead company.
- The transaction between Bankrate and InsWeb aims to allow Bankrate to gain access to InsWeb's patents and expand its market share.
- Risks include financing problems, antitrust risks, and poor cash allocation, but these are mitigated by Bankrate's cash flow and the deal's structure.
- Valuation estimates predict the stock price rising to around $9.35 with conservative estimates.
- The deal is currently measured with a 57% chance of going through, which is believed to be too low.
- The opportunity exists due to the relatively small transaction size of $65 million and the lack of high publicity for the deal.
- The deal is expected to go through by Q1 2012, and it is recommended to buy a full position of INSW at current market prices."
Connor__Maxygen__SIR.pdf,"Maxygen (MAXY) announced a joint venture with Astellas Pharma in July 2009, becoming a non-operating company to monetize its assets and return value to shareholders. The Perseid JV, in which MAXY has 83% ownership, is a clinical stage venture formed with Astellas. Astellas contributed $10mm and received a 17% stake in Perseid, worth approximately $59mm currently. Astellas has specified call prices through 2012. The JV is performing well, with Astellas making a $5mm milestone payment recently.

After the Astellas deal, the management team owns 13.5% of Maxygen and is incentivized to maximize shareholder value. Valuation includes cash, cash burn, Bayer payment, and the Perseid JV with Astellas. Maxygen is eligible for a $30mm milestone payment from Bayer based on certain conditions. The failure to meet these conditions could reduce the payment. Valuation details show potential upside based on Astellas' buy-in price.

The opportunity exists due to Maxygen's small size and lack of interest from large investors. The company is undervalued, essentially trading at cash value, ignoring its valuable assets like the Astellas JV. The recommendation is to initiate a large position and hold at least until the end of 2012 for potential rewards."
Connor__NILSY__SIR.pdf,"A lucrative odd-lot tender opportunity was identified by the Special Ops Team, including Connor Haley, Peter Chase, Anuj Shah, and Rob Boling. An odd-lot tender offer is a specific form of a share buyback where shareholders who own less than 100 shares can offer to sell their shares back to the company. This form of share buyback helps companies reduce the high cost of servicing small shareholder accounts.

The company involved in this opportunity is Norilsk Nickel Mining and Metallurgical Co (NILSY.PK), a Russia-based company that is the world's leading producer of nickel, palladium, platinum, copper, and cobalt. The company announced a self-tender offer to purchase 14,705,882 ordinary common shares and/or ADSs at $306 per common share and $30.60 per ADS.

The spread between the current price and the tender price offers a potential annualized return of 1283.12%. Shareholders with less than 1000 ADSs or 100 common stock will not be subject to pro-ration, creating a great investment opportunity.

The players involved in this opportunity include two Russian oligarchs, Oleg Deripaska and Vladimir Potanin, who both want control of the company. Potanin has a greater stake, more board seats, and a better relationship with management than Deripaska. Taking the odd-lot offer could benefit Potanin and potentially avoid an expensive mandatory offer.

There are antitrust risks associated with the deal that must be approved by the Russian equivalent of the FTC. However, the company believes that the offer will not violate antitrust laws. Downside protection is provided by the company's strong market position and limited downside risk.

Based on the analysis, the recommendation is to purchase 118 ADS (NILSY.PK) at a limit price of $21.10 before October 24th, 2011, to ensure completion by the October 28th deadline."

Karti__BAMM__SIR.pdf,"Books-A-Million (BAMM) is a book retailer in the southeastern United States that operates superstores and traditional bookstores. They offer a wide selection of best sellers, hardcover and paperback books, magazines, and newspapers in-store and online. Despite recent operating losses, BAMM maintains consistent returns and non-cyclical revenue streams, with a favorable Price/Book Ratio and unique book selection.

Opportunities for BAMM include undervalued stock, straightforward company valuation, online expansion, and regional expansions in the Southern US. However, threats such as e-books stealing market share and a lack of a strong online presence pose challenges. BAMM's main competitors are upscale stores with entrenched market positions in the Southeast, and they have a partnership with Barnes and Noble for the Nook.

Financially, BAMM is more profitable than Barnes and Borders, with a lower Price/Book ratio. They have a better balance sheet and higher profitability, despite declining revenue growth and weak margins. Positive signs include rising cash reserves, decreasing receivables, and increasing retained earnings. Negative signs include high cost of revenue and declining dividends.

Investors are interested in buying BAMM due to its low Price/Book ratio compared to historical levels and its potential for a 50% return if it returns to previous trading levels. Overall, BAMM presents a potentially lucrative investment opportunity with some challenges to overcome."

Kwon-Yong__CCX__SIR.pdf,"Sofia Hou & Kwon-Yong Jin have analyzed the COMMODITY CURRENCY ETF (CCX) offered by Wisdom Tree. The ETF focuses on commodity currencies, which benefit during periods of global growth and US inflation while having less downside risk than commodities themselves. The makeup of CCX includes an equal weighting between developed and emerging markets, with currencies such as the Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Russian ruble, South African rand, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Norwegian krone, and New Zealand dollar. The ETF also includes commodities from countries that are the world's largest exporters of various goods, such as gold, silver, nickel, natural gas, and more.

The 52-week return for CCX is 9.43%, with an expense ratio of 0.55% and a current price of $27.91. The ETF offers advantages such as hedging against US inflation and providing diversification to traditional bond and stock portfolios. However, there are dangers to consider, such as the possibility of commodities being in a bubble and recent declines in metal prices. 

In summary, Hou & Jin recommend buying CCX as it serves as a good hedge against US inflation and provides a diversification strategy for existing portfolios. They suggest that CCX offers balance to their current equity-heavy portfolio and is a valuable addition for investors looking to diversify their holdings."
Kwon-Yong__Linkedin__SIR.pdf,"LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD) is a professional networking site that went public with an IPO in May 2011. It allows members to create professional profiles, upload their resumes, and build professional networks. The company has been expanding rapidly, with a revenue CAGR of 76%.

LinkedIn operates on three revenue streams: ""Hiring solutions"" such as job postings, corporate solutions, ""Marketing solutions"" through ads, and premium subscriptions like Business, Business Plus, and Executive subscription products. The revenue breakdown for the company as of June 30, 2011, was 48% from Hiring Solutions, 32% from Marketing Solutions, and 20% from Premium Subscriptions.

The main costs for LinkedIn include overhead for web hosting and operations, sales and marketing, product development, and general/administrative expenses. The company had a successful IPO on May 19, 2011, with an initial valuation of $3 billion, which increased to $9 billion after one day of trading.

Financial statistics for LinkedIn show significant growth in assets, liabilities, net revenue, operating income, and EPS. However, the company has downsides such as a high valuation (1000x P/E), lack of profitability in the near future, and increased costs due to field marketing. There is also a concern about a possible short squeeze, but LinkedIn has enough cash to protect its position.

In conclusion, there are doubts about the true user base of LinkedIn, as a substantial majority of members do not visit the site regularly. The high valuation and potential short squeeze make the stock risky, but LinkedIn has enough cash on hand to handle temporary price fluctuations."

They have initiated bridge loan financing with American Wagering and have already made payments to key personnel to stay on post-merger.

They specialize in both men and women's fine accessories, including handbags, business cases, accessories, footwear, clothing, sunwear, luggage, watches, and fragrances. The main focus of the company is on handbags, with manufacturing primarily done in Asia.

The company operates in two main business segments: Direct-to-Consumer and Indirect (Department Stores). Direct-to-Consumer includes retail stores in North America, Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, mainland China, as well as online and catalog sales. The company also has factory stores that sell discontinued or irregular inventory. Indirect sales are made through department stores and wholesalers in the US and internationally.

The company's main competitors include luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Gucci, as well as lower-end brands like Cole Haan and Dooney & Burke.

The luxury goods industry is characterized by cyclical trends, with significant growth in Asia, particularly China. Coach faces moderate supplier power due to raw material prices, mainly leather, but benefits from buying materials in large volumes. Buyer power is also moderate, with no switching costs for consumers. The threat of substitutes is high, but Coach's brand recognition and pricing strategies help retain customers.

Recent expansions have seen Coach entering new markets in Japan, China, and Europe, with plans for further growth. Financially, the company has shown positive results, with strong revenue and profit margins. Despite competition from upscale designers and counterfeiting threats, Coach remains a stable and growing company.

Based on the analysis, the recommendation is to buy Coach, Inc. (COH) stock, with a target price of $75. The company's growth opportunities in Asia, stable performance, and strong financials make it an attractive investment opportunity."

Peter__Petrobras__SIR.pdf,"Peter Hadar and Greg McDouglas provided a detailed summary of Petrobras, a Brazilian energy company specializing in oil and natural gas exploration, production, and distribution. In 2010, the company averaged 2.583 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 83% oil and 17% natural gas. Petrobras is the largest company in Latin America and partially publicly owned, with government support from the new President who was previously the ex-Board Chairwoman. The company's business segments include Energy and Petroleum (25%), Supply (45%), Gas and Energy (4%), Distribution (19%), and International operations mainly in Argentina (7%).

The company's stock is trading at $40.33 per share with a market capitalization of $263.04 billion, making it the second-largest publicly traded oil company in the world after ExxonMobil. Petrobras has an enterprise value of $292.75 billion, a beta of 1.36, and a dividend yield of 0.4%. Financial ratios indicate a P/E of 9.4 (industry average 20.1 for Oil & Gas drilling and Exploration), Price/Book of 1.4 (industry average 2.3), and ROE of 18.0% (industry average 10.8%).

Despite a low P/E ratio possibly due to debt, Petrobras has strong fundamentals with debt numbers similar to past years and profitability. The company's current ratio of 1.9 reflects its ability to meet short-term obligations. Challenges include uncertainty about the industry's installed capacity meeting future demands and lack of information on new oil fields.

Petrobras has promising prospects with recent discoveries in off-shore pre-salt layer oil megafields such as Tupi, Jupiter, and joint ventures. Oil demand has increased recently and is expected to rise further, while supply growth is slower. The company is expanding in Latin America with acquisitions in Argentina and operations in other countries.

The investment thesis for Petrobras includes good financial performance, government support, a strong presence in Latin America and the oil market, consistent oil discoveries, and potential for growth. The recommendation is to buy Petrobras stock."

Sofia__LPHI__SIR.pdf,"Life Partner Holdings Inc. (LPHI) is a company that securitizes life insurance policies by buying and repackaging life insurance policies of elderly individuals to sell to investors. Investors pay premiums and receive death benefits in return. The total value of life insurance policies in the US is $26 trillion.

As of January 29, 2011, the market cap of LPHI was $283.81 million before, and the current market cap is $203.59 million. The stock price before was $19.02, and the current price is $9.99 (approximately $12.49 if stocks didn't split 5:4).

Financial ratios from Reuters show changes before and now: Current ratio increased from 2.77 to 4.02, PB ratio decreased from 5.58 to 2.62, PE ratio decreased from 9.66 to 8.06, PEG ratio changed from 0.68 to -0.22, and ROA decreased from 54.17 to 38.29.

Recent investigations revealed that LPHI significantly underestimated life expectancies of policyholders, leading to misrepresented returns to investors. The company's success was based on attractive projected returns for clients, but actual life expectancies were found to be three times longer than projected. Founder Mr. Pardo was once charged with overstating company profits in a previous company.

The SEC initiated a probe in response to these reports, and LPHI may need to adjust the way it calculates life expectancies. The company faces allegations of misrepresenting returns, withholding risks from investors, and lacking trustworthy calculations.

Several lawsuits have been filed against LPHI, alleging violations of law by certain officers and directors. Investors are advised to consider selling their shares in the company."
Sofia__Pfizer__SIR.pdf,"Pfizer (PFE) is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company with a diverse healthcare portfolio that includes human and animal biologic and small molecule medicines, vaccines, nutritional products, and consumer healthcare products. The company is divided into Primary Care, Specialty Care, Established Products, Emerging Markets, and Oncology divisions, with a market capitalization of $157.43 billion.

In March 2011, a former marketing executive filed a lawsuit against Pfizer, and the company completed the acquisition of Kings Pharmaceuticals. In December 2010, Ian Read replaced Jeff Kindler as the new CEO, and in October 2010, Pfizer acquired FoldRX, a drug discovery and clinical development company. In December 2009, Pfizer sold Vicuron Pharmaceuticals to Durata Therapeutics.

Historically, Pfizer was valued at $26.66, but currently, the stock has broken a 52-week high after being in a rut for a while. The company's stock prices have been climbing since the CEO switch. Investors are now waiting on the Q1 2011 financial results.

A discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis was conducted with conservative, fair, and optimistic assumptions. The conservative scenario assumes revenue growth at 1%, a 10% discount rate, and a 35% tax rate, resulting in a value of $9.65. By adjusting the assumptions to more fair values, such as revenue growth at 5% in the first years, a 6.57% discount rate, and a 25% tax rate, the value increases to $21.50. Changing the terminal growth rate to 2% further increases the value to $24.38."
