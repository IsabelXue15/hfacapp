Recent liquidity events in the Montney region have seen Chinook comps set at various valuations. The valuation metrics of peers in the Montney region suggest a positive outlook for Chinook's valuation.

Jae__BlueNile__SIR.pdf,"Summary:
Blue Nile, a Seattle-based online retailer of diamonds and fine jewelry, has faced challenges with stagnant revenue growth and operational inefficiencies. However, the company has implemented a new marketing strategy involving Web Rooms to increase brand awareness and drive growth. This initiative is expected to lead to a significant increase in revenue and improve operating income.

The Harvard Financial Analysts Club recommends buying NILE stock with a target price of $47.57, representing a potential 34% upside."
Jae__HNH__SIR.pdf,"Handy & Harman Ltd. (HNH) is a company that manufactures niche industrial products with a focus on high-margin engineered products. They serve a variety of industries including construction, electrical, electronics, transportation, utility, medical, oil & gas exploration, aerospace, and defense. HNH has been acquisitive, buying 4 companies in the last 3 years while divesting certain businesses. Their primary product lines include Joining Materials, Tubing, Building Materials, Performance Materials, and Kasco Blades and Route Repair.

The building materials segment is the largest by revenue and has above-average margins, especially as construction continues to recover. The Performance Materials segment is expected to turn around after one-time expenses. Tubing margins are impressive and rising. The steel industry has suffered from overcapacity and lowered demand, but the market has already priced in this downward trend. China, the world's largest producer and consumer of steel, is shifting towards technology and services.

The industry is showing signs of resurgence with metrics like building permit volume and construction spending pointing towards growth. US housing sales are on the rise, and the acquisition market for steel companies has surged. Global urbanization is expected to fuel rising demand for steel in the long term.

The management team has a solid background in finance and managing large companies. Revenue has grown in recent years through acquisitions and organic growth, although lower precious metal prices have impacted margins. HNH has a relatively low cost of capital and the current price implies negative revenue growth over the next five years, which seems unlikely based on projections.

The likely acquisition of HNH by Steel Partners Holdings is a catalyst for future growth. The risks include macroeconomic trends affecting the steel industry and financial obligations like pension plans. The potential acquisition of HNH by Steel Partners Holdings seems likely and would be beneficial for both companies. The implied share price of HNH is $32.27 in the base case scenario. Overall, HNH is seen as a solid company with good potential for growth and acquisition."
Michael__RH__SIR.pdf,"Restoration Hardware (RH) is a retailer of high-end luxury home furnishings, with a business model focused on transforming the retail experience in the home furnishings industry. The company sells furniture, decor, textiles, bathware, lighting, and more, with 85 stores around the nation. RH operates as a lifestyle brand and has strong fundamentals for long-term revenue growth through brand improvements and customer loyalty.

Key financials show a market cap of $1.17B, diluted shares outstanding at 40.7M, and an enterprise value of $1.57B. The company's gross margin is 35.7% and EBITDA margin is 10.9%. Despite a market overreaction to short-term issues, the thesis suggests that RH's margins will recover and grow back to historical levels. The company operates in a niche market with high barriers to entry and a focus on customer satisfaction for a luxury ""lifestyle brand"".

RH has faced challenges related to the launch of RH Modern, which resulted in a decrease in gross margins, production delays, and a decline in comparable brand revenue growth. The market's perspective on RH Modern was initially bullish, but concerns arose due to production delays and timing issues related to the launch of the membership model. The company's CEO, Gary Friedman, has a vision for brand transformation focused on next-generation gallery expansion, a new membership model, and a rebranding initiative.

Catalysts for margin growth include the successful rollout of RH Modern, real estate expansion strategy, and the new membership model. Valuation assumptions suggest a base case with 27% upside and a bull case with 74% upside, based on the company's ability to recover to historical gross margins and drive revenue growth.

Risks include reputational risk, macroeconomic factors, failure of the membership model, and stagnation in sales growth. However, the thesis concludes that RH has strong fundamentals, is undervalued, and has the potential for long-term revenue growth and margin recovery through successful brand repositioning and innovation."
Panera__SIR.pdf,"Panera (PNRA) is a St. Louis-based chain of fast casual bakery-cafés that offers relatively healthy alternatives to traditional fast food restaurants. It was initially a subsidiary of Au Bon Pain Co., which sold off everything except for Panera Bread when it started gaining popularity. The company has roughly 2,000 bakery-cafés, with half being company-owned and the other half being franchises.

Panera launched Panera 2.0 in 2015, which aims to enhance the customer experience through technology. The company also plans to expand by launching a delivery service and adding more stores. The company has a market cap of $5.0 billion, with an EV of $5.17 billion. Key metrics include a ROIC of 17.3%, P/E of 34x, P/B of 9.8x, EV/EBIT of 19.3x, and EV/EBITDA of 12.6x.

The thesis for investing in Panera includes sustainable revenue growth driven by demographic trends, rollout of Panera 2.0 and delivery service, under-penetration in certain markets, and a profitable and easily scalable business model. The company has seen growth in same-store sales in its company-owned cafés, especially those converted to 2.0. Additionally, Panera's focus on healthy fast food aligns with changing eating habits, particularly among Millennials.

The potential for expansion includes the Panera 2.0 program, online to-go ordering, fast ordering kiosks, and table ordering. The delivery service is expected to boost demand and increase revenue. Unit economics are favorable, with company-operated stores showing a ROIC of 9.0% and franchisees at 17.3%. Management, led by CEO Ronald Shaich, has significant experience in the restaurant industry and owns a considerable amount of company shares.

Overall, Panera offers a strong investment opportunity with potential for sustainable growth, a focus on healthy eating trends, and a proven business model."
Preetam__LIND__SIR.pdf,"Lindblad Expeditions Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: LIND) is a company that offers expedition cruises and adventure travel experiences to over 40 destinations on all seven continents. The company focuses on close interaction with nature and wildlife, using smaller and more nimble ships to access places that larger vessels cannot. They provide premium offerings with prices over $1,000 per night and have a fleet of 10 ships, 6 of which are owned and 4 are leased.

The company has a strategic partnership with National Geographic, which provides about 25% of ticket revenue for Lindblad. National Geographic also sources staff, including scholars and scientists, to be on board the ships and provide educational presentations. This partnership gives National Geographic the option to acquire a 5% equity stake in Lindblad.

Lindblad recently acquired 80.1% of Natural Habitat Adventures, a leading land-based adventure travel and ecotourism company. The acquisition is expected to yield rapid near-term growth, with potential revenue synergies due to significant overlap in target demographics. Lindblad is also expanding its fleet by adding three new ships, which are expected to add around $110 million in revenue by 2020 once all three are deployed.

The company was listed through a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, which has led to weak analyst following. However, the unique cruise-liner offering and partnership with National Geographic provide Lindblad with a significant competitive advantage. Despite a revenue and margin contraction in Q2 2016, the company's underlying strength remains intact.

Lindblad's valuation shows potential upside based on expanded fleet and revenue growth projections. The company trades at a slight discount relative to peers but has high near-term growth and above-average free cash flow conversion. The stock selloff in Q2 2016 was due to temporary factors, and the company is expected to continue its growth trajectory."
